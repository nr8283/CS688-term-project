Q: Applied Data Analytics program requirements
A: The Master of Science in Applied Data Analytics program requires a total of 32 units. This includes six core courses (24 units) and additional courses as specified. The core course is MET CS 544 Foundations of Analytics and Data Visualization, which provides the mathematical and practical background required in the field of data analytics. 

Students must also complete a total of four courses (16 units) from the following:

1. MET AD 571 Business Analytics Foundations (prerequisite: AD100 Pre-Analytics Laboratory)
2. Three additional courses from the following options:
   - MET AD 616 Enterprise Risk Analytics (prerequisite: MET AD 571)
   - MET AD 654 Marketing Analytics (prerequisite: MET AD 571)
   - MET AD 688 and MET AD 699 (prerequisites may apply)

Students currently enrolled in a graduate certificate program can transition into the master's degree without needing to submit a new application, but they should contact their academic advisor to declare their interest in this pathway.
