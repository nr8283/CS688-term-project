 Actionable Sustainability


Fall  ‘25
Sustainability generally refers to the ability of "systems" to be maintained such that they remain viable over long periods of time. As much as achieving the perfect sustainable equilibrium may be the ideal, it is important to recognize that there will be competing and conflicting interests, especially within complex hierarchical social, economic and ecological systems, particularly in light of ongoing climatic change. This field intensive course draws on the practices and theories of sustainability and climate change to understand what sustainability can mean in different contexts, and, more important, how nuanced, sustainable solutions can be achieved under varying conditions and in different systems. With an emphasis on the urban environment, the course will consist of projects in which students will identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real world issues. This course is intended for a wider audience from a range of disciplines.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Python and SQL for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD100 - Python is a modern, high-level programming language. One of the most popular programming languages, its use has steadily increased across a large number of industries. This course introduces students to the Python environment and teaches a solid foundation in the basic syntax and structure. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most common language globally for interacting with relational databases. Employers have indicated that knowledge of SQL is one of the most important skills for new graduates entering the workforce. Even with advances in database technologies and languages for handling heterogeneous data types, SQL remains the core skill for interacting with data. This course introduces both languages to equip students pursuing an analytics education with the skills necessary to succeed in the analytics and data visualization field. The outcome of this course will be a focused survey of Python and SQL topics designed to equip analytics professionals rather than a deep focus on technical programming topics.  [ 4 cr. ]
