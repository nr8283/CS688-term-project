Prepare to Take on Cybercrime Investigation Jobs


Offered on campus and online, the Graduate Certificate in Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity—offered jointly by the departments of Applied Social Sciences and Computer Science at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET)—is an excellent option for law enforcement officers, computer science-related personnel, business personnel, and others who seek professional development in the high-demand area of cybercrime investigation.


While traditional crime has been on the decline since the 1990s, cybercrime has been on the rise. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), from its inception in 2000 through 2019, there have been 4,883,231 complaints received. In the years since 2015, IC3 reported an average of more than 340,000 complaints annually, with $10.2 billion in financial losses. That is just the tip of the iceberg, however, as some estimate that only 1 in 10 incidents are reported to law enforcement.


With cybercrime occurring globally, and across jurisdictions, the challenges for police are real, as is the need for specialized resources and expertise in cybercrime investigation training. BU MET’s certificate in Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity provides practical and essential knowledge of cybercrime and cybersecurity—and as a graduate you are eligible to take the forensic examiner certification exams.

"I believe the education I received at BU will make me more marketable within my agency and provide me with additional external opportunities. There is certainly a need in law enforcement for a greater number of investigators who know how to conduct cybercrime investigations and can understand the different sources of potential digital evidence."

Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate Curriculum

A total of four courses (16 units) is required, as follows:


MET CJ 610
 Cybercrime


Fall  ‘25
This course is designed to help students understand and apply the nature of computer crime in the criminal justice field. Several theories (both micro-level and macro-level) will be presented and will be analyzed in depth and applied to computer crime cases both past and present. Students will see how major theories have been re-developed to be applied to computer crime, and by using these theories, students will both develop and explore different strategies for future law enforcement. Students will be presented with common types of fraudulent schemes, as well as several laws that have been enacted and developed specifically for computer crime. In addition, causes, victimization, legal issues, control strategies, and societal costs regarding the cybercrime problem will be explored and evaluated.  [ 4 cr. ]

This course is designed to engage students for conducting successful forensic examinations of digital devices and computer networks with hands-on-experience within the Virtual Security Lab. The course introduces EnCase forensic software, which has received the high acceptance rate in a court of law as an expert witness. The course aims to cover various cybercrime topics and digital forensic investigation practices using digital evidence samples. In the process of learning, students will explore the nature of specific cybercrime and be able to successfully analyze and document the digital evidence related to the crime.   [ 4 cr. ]






And two courses from the following:


MET CJ 620
 Cyberterrorism and Cyber Defense


Fall  ‘25
Cyber-terrorists continuously leverage sophisticated techniques in efforts to attack the nation's critical infrastructures by damaging their functionalities and stealing highly sensitive intellectual property, private information, and valuable assets. This course is designed to explore a new explanatory angle for studying cyberterrorism issues from a cyber- intelligence perspective. Major cyberterrorism cases will be empirically analyzed and applied into a lab environment for gaining hands-on-experience and to develop defensive strategies and counter measures. This course aims to examine three main types of cyberterrorism 1) Information Attacks, 2) Infrastructure Attacks, and 3) Technology Facilitation for building both technical capability and a set of policy recommendations to counter these potential threats.  [ 4 cr. ]

 White-Collar Crime


This course introduces students to the concept of white collar crime as an area of scientific inquiry and theory formation. It critically examines the latest scholarship on the subject by looking at white collar crime through a multiplicity of perspectives and reference points. These range from focus on the offense, offender, legal structure, organizational structure, individual, and organizational behavior, to victimization and guardianship, with special attention on the interaction between these components. The course also assesses the nature, extent, and consequences of white collar crime nationally and internationally. To enhance the understanding of white collar crime in today's Information Technology development, the course will pay special attention to roles of IT including fintech and cryptocurrency connections within white collar crime. It will also introduce rapidly emerging cybercrime issues while discussing various challenges of cybercrime investigation and limited digital forensics tools. Finally, the course examines current criminal justice system efforts at controlling white collar crime. Given the relative ineffectiveness of traditional criminal justice responses, alternative systems of control will be examined, ranging from compliance and regulations, private security, and public opinion, to prevention. Students will visit the websites of various government agencies or professional organizations to explore their functions and their current efforts to fight white collar crimes. Finally, many tangible research- based suggestions will be made regarding actions that organizations and businesses can take to reduce losses accrued due to white collar crime.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET CJ 812
 Cybersecurity Capstone


Information systems and data protection continue to be a challenge on a global scale. Devastating cyber-attacks have increased and show no sign of slowing down. This course is designed to enhance the student's capabilities and potential to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats through the application of relevant threat modeling as well as the application of best practice tools and techniques to reduce the threat to organizations, users, and systems. The course aims to enhance the current capacities of higher education to better serve students of cybersecurity, leading to improved cybercrime investigations and successful prosecutions. This course is a three-phased approach to educating students in the development of a hacker mindset to better understand adversarial cybersecurity threats, attacks, and techniques. The three-phased approach for this course includes 1) Cybersecurity Threat Modeling, 2)Cybersecurity Tools and Techniques, and 3) Cybersecurity Practical Exercises. Classroom activities, discussions, and assignments will address all three phases and progressively prepare the student to perform at a high level in a culminating applied final project.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET CS 684
