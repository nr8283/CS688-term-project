Develop Expertise in Global Supply Chain Analytics


The 
Master of Science in Supply Chain Management (MSSCM)
 concentration in Analytics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) will prepare you to apply descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytical methods to supply networks using R programming language and other specialized programming languages. Focused on the needs of supply chain decision-makers who must navigate the ever-changing and increasingly complex networks of facilities, partners, suppliers, and other domestic and international stakeholders, the MSSCM Analytics concentration will prepare you to utilize mathematical modeling and optimization theory by choosing the appropriate quantitative tools to support supply chain operations, while applying systematic process-oriented approaches to evaluate supply chain performance using statistical modeling with Six Sigma principles and techniques.


By applying analytics to operations such sourcing, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation, supply chain managers can improve efficiency in their organizations. The ability to analyze data also provides a clearer understanding of risk, increased accuracy in planning, enhanced end-to-end visibility, and a means of achieving a leaner supply chain.


In addition, those with supply chain-related analytics experience are well-positioned to fill a significant skills gap. A report by Grand View Research projects that the global supply chain analytics market—valued at $4.55 billion in 2020—will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3 percent through 2028. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment of operations research analysts will grow 25 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations, with an annual median wage of $86,200 in 2020.

Advance Your Career in Supply Chain Management


Offered online and on campus, BU MET’s Analytics concentration in the Supply Chain Management master’s degree program covers supply chain strategies, analysis and mitigation of supply chain risks, management of performance, quality control, inventory and capacity management, and all other operations-related analyses. Analytical techniques include statistical analysis, probabilistic decision-tree analysis, control charting, process capability analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation and optimization techniques. Capstone projects provide an opportunity to work on real-world business problems for prominent client firms while resources such as the 
Decision Sciences Research Laboratory
 connect you to the supply chain industry through collaborative applied research.


According to the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), supply chain jobs—including high-tech roles in data analysis, cloud solutions, supply chain planning, and risk management—are projected to grow in line with the national average of 9 percent over the course of the next decade. In their 2023 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a graduate degree is $113,300. In addition, the career satisfaction is high with 96% professionals planning to stay in the field in the following five years.

 Business Analytics Foundations


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: AD100 Pre-Analytics Laboratory
This course presents fundamental knowledge and skills for applying business analytics to managerial decision-making in corporate environments. Topics include descriptive analytics (techniques for categorizing, characterizing, consolidating, and classifying data for conversion into useful information for the purposes of understanding and analyzing business performance), predictive analytics (techniques for detection of hidden patterns in large quantities of data to segment and group data into coherent sets in order to predict behavior and trends), prescriptive analytics (techniques for identification of best alternatives for maximizing or minimizing business objectives). Students will learn how to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable analytics-based decisions. The framework of using interlinked data inputs, analytics models, and decision-support tools will be applied within a proprietary business analytics shell and demonstrated with examples from different functional areas of the enterprise.

 Data Mining for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD571
Enterprises, organizations, and individuals are creating, collecting, and using a massive amount of structured and unstructured data with the goal of converting the information into knowledge, improving the quality and the efficiency of their decision-making process, and better positioning themselves in the highly competitive marketplace. Data mining is the process of finding, extracting, visualizing, and reporting useful information and insights from both small and large datasets with the help of sophisticated data analysis methods. It is part of business analytics, which refers to the process of leveraging different forms of analytical techniques to achieve desired business outcomes through requiring business relevancy, actionable insight, performance management, and value management. The students in this course will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining. They will learn how to apply advanced models and software applications for data mining. Finally, students will learn how to examine the overall business process of an organization or a project with the goal of understanding (i) the business context where hidden internal and external value is to be identified and captured, and (ii) exactly what the selected data mining method does. Python, R, SQL, and Power BI software are used in this course.  [ 4 cr. ]
