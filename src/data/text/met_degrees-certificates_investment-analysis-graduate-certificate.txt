Understand Investment Analysis & Portfolio Risk


Offered online and on campus, the Graduate Certificate in Investment Analysis at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides in-depth knowledge of investment strategies, asset valuation, and investment management. Designed for professionals already working in, or seeking positions in, investment research, risk management, security selection, and portfolio management, the program will prepare you to excel at a variety of careers in finance involving analysis and valuation of financial assets as well as risk management.


As you study the overall investment process, as well as the key elements involved, such as asset allocation and security selection, you will obtain basic understanding of debt, equity, and derivatives securities such as options and futures contracts. BU MET’s Investment Analysis graduate certificate introduces services provided by mutual funds and ensures that you are able to construct portfolios with different risk levels, while gaining an in-depth understanding of systematic and firm-specific risks—and how to reduce firm-specific risk by combining different securities in a portfolio. Additionally, you will study the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) concept; be able to calculate bond prices, accrued interest, promised yields, and realized yields; and understand active bond portfolio management. Moreover, you will learn how to value a firm using constant growth or multistage dividend discount models, financial statements, and financial ratio analysis.


The Investment Analysis certificate is excellent preparation for the internationally recognized Chartered Financial Analyst
®
 (CFA) Program exams, and shares courses with BU MET’s 
MS in Financial Management
, which is part of the CFA Institute University Affiliation Program.


“As my former students know, I start each course by telling the students, ‘What is happening in the classroom is happening in the business world, and what is happening in the business world is happening in the classroom.’ Academic principles and concepts are the base of our courses and teachings, but I try to bring the practical applications of these principles and concepts to the classroom. I tell a lot of stories in the classroom. The stories are my way of showing the students what really takes place in business and how they can advance in their careers.”
