Learn How to Think Like an Actuary


Available on campus and online, the Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Foundations at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides a set of courses that cultivates your ability to “think like an actuary.” The approach helps develop actuarial problem-solving skills through exposure to topics, including interest theory and probability, that are crucial to the growing field of actuarial work.


By completing the Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Foundations, you will be able to work with simple actuarial models in insurance companies, consulting firms, and related industries. The Actuarial Foundations graduate certificate introduces concepts that are further built upon in the 
Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Science
.


Preparation for Professional Examinations


BU MET’s Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Foundations courses are designed to help you build an understanding of the subject matter while providing sufficient background to be successful in passing the following Society of Actuaries (SoA) exams: P and FM. Passing these exams, and the units you will receive for successfully passing Financial Mathematics (MET AT 521) and Economics and Management Decisions (MET AT 511), or an equivalent MET course approved by the advisor, will put you in a good position to receive a “Pre-Actuarial Foundations” micro-credential from the SoA. Studies recently undertaken by the SoA indicate that this knowledge and these skills are in high demand within insurance and related fields.

, BU MET provides an excellent academic foundation and practical exposure to real-world business environments. 


If you have an analytical mind and enjoy working with financial theory, a career as an actuary could be an excellent opportunity for you. Actuarial science uses a combination of statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, data science, and other fields to allow actuaries to make crucial policy decisions in an unpredictable business world. With this specialized knowledge comes enhanced compensation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median salary for recent actuarial science graduates is higher than the average for other professions. And, the 
BLS predicts a 23 percent increase
 in opportunities through 2032.


With a faculty made up of academic actuaries, practicing actuaries, and actuaries who have extensive real-world experience, BU MET’s programs in Actuarial Science help you develop the skills you need to become a credentialed actuary.
