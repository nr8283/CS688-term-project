Develop Valuable Crime Analysis Skills with a Graduate Certificate


Available on campus and online, the Graduate Certificate in Crime Analysis at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) is an interdisciplinary program that develops your ability to use and analyze a variety of data sources to inform the investigations, strategies, and policy decisions of criminal justice organizations.


Crime analysis is crucial to a growing field within law enforcement and related domains in criminal justice. Policework is not just knocking on doors and interviewing witnesses anymore. Data-driven and intelligence-led approaches to crime have become the standard among contemporary criminal justice organizations. The proliferation of data generated by surveillance cameras, body cams, GPS, mobile devices, social media, email and text exchanges, wearable tech, sensors, and other sources has enhanced the potential to map hotspots, discern patterns and trends, gather evidence, solve crimes, and demonstrate results. Having the skills to analyze this data is critical for tactical, operational, and strategic efforts in law enforcement, and essential to research and policy development and reform.


BU MET’s Crime Analysis certificate prepares students to fill in-house crime analyst roles or similar positions, while strengthening the skills of those working in investigations, management, and operations to utilize analysis more effectively.

Crime Analysis Graduate Certificate Curriculum

A total of four courses (16 units) is required, as follows:


MET CJ 591
 Applied Analytical Methods


Fall  ‘25
Evidence-based and data-driven approaches to crime problems are the industry standard among criminal justice agencies and non-governmental organizations. This course will cover a variety of statistical "tools" from three broad areas: (1) descriptive statistics, (2) inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, and (3) measures of association. Students will learn how to develop research questions, describe and draw conclusions from quantitative data, and interpret statistical research findings, and be able to present these findings to a variety of audiences in a clear and accurate way -- to be able to "tell a story" with numbers. In addition, students will develop a proficiency working with large data sets and conducting analysis with a critical lens, using the analytical software -- Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) -- commonly used in criminal justice and related fields.   [ 4 cr. ]

 Crime and Intelligence Analysis


Fall  ‘25
Contemporary law enforcement agencies regularly employ crime and intelligence analysis to develop and inform effective responses to crime. This course provides an in-depth examination of crime and intelligence analysis techniques. It also explores the role of the crime and intelligence analyst within law enforcement organizations and processes, the historical evolution of this approach, key legal and policy issues, and challenges to implementation. Students have the opportunity to apply these skills to case study simulations involving an array of common crime problems and cases using real-world examples and sources of information.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Foundations of GIS and Spatial Analysis


Fall  ‘25
Foundations of GIS and Spatial Analysis provides an introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specifically with a focus on applications in urban planning. The role of spatial analysis in local, state, and regional planning has steadily increased over the last decade with the infusion of windows-based GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS. The class focus is to prepare students to feel comfortable communicating with other GIS users, research spatial data, and produce high-quality digital maps in an applied learning environment.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Performance Management Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Data analysis informs administration, management and accountability processes within criminal justice and related organizations. While traditional crime analysis often narrowly seeks to improve the organization's effectiveness towards public safety outcomes, management and accountability analysis seeks to also ensure fair, efficient, transparent, and accountable practices as well. This course examines contemporary management and accountability practices with an emphasis on the ways in which data can be employed to improve these practices. Students will learn skills to work with real data sources across justice-system domains, from policing to corrections, as well as community-based organizations. Contemporary challenges, such as disparate treatment, abuse of force, 'overpolicing,' frame discussions and assignments. Students will understand the strengths and limitations of data-informed approaches. The course is valuable to students seeking careers in analytical roles, other practitioners, non-profit managers, and those interested in justice reform more broadly.   [ 4 cr. ]

 Threat Assessment


Fall  ‘25
Threat assessment is a systematic strategy for identifying, assessing, and preventing potential violent incidents. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining insights from criminology, law enforcement, psychiatry, and psychology, behavioral threat assessment is designed to provide alternatives to violence before an attack occurs. In this class, students will learn the principles of behavioral threat assessment and explore ongoing developments in the field by reviewing case examples and studies of school shooters, mass murderers, lone actor terrorists, as well as more common offender types such as domestic violence offenders. The course is intended for a wide variety of law enforcement officers, mental health practitioners, school administrators, workplace managers, and public officials who are charged with maintaining community safety.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Applied Crime Analysis Project


Fall  ‘25
Students in the Crime Analysis (CA) concentration or certificate program are encouraged to engaged in a supervised project as part of their degree. The project is supervised by an instructor, typically the concentration area coordinator. It can be used to fulfill a 4-credit elective course within the concentration or certificate. Project-based and experiential learning activities are central to graduate professional education and to our own program's learning outcomes. The project gives students an opportunity to enhance and synthesize skills learned in other courses, apply skills to real-world problems and settings, and make connections into the professional field. Projects in the CA concentration or certificate will focus applied research and analytical methodologies and/or organizational processes connected to analysis within criminal justice or related agencies.  [ 4 cr. ]
