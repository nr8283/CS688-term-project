“My favorite course was Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management (MET AD 717), because it is so useful for finance practitioners in a variety of positions, and I believe it will help me earn my CFA certification. Even though I have finished the course, I continue to study it deeply. It involved knowledge of financial institutions, equity evaluation, fixed income analysis, and portfolio management for financial institutions and high net-worth individuals. I used much of what I learned in this course during my summer internship. One of my responsibilities was to develop and implement investment strategies for clients. My senior manager was satisfied with my work writing an IPS (Investment Policy Statement) and strategizing asset allocation and portfolio management plans for clients.”

part-time per-unit rate
. If you enroll in 3–4 courses (12–16 units) in a semester, you are charged the

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
