Master the Tools of Visual & Digital Health Communication


The online Graduate Certificate in Visual & Digital Health Communication at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) examines the impact of the communication technology revolution on the field of health marketing and outreach and equips graduates with the modern visual and digital storytelling tools necessary for careers in this rapidly evolving industry.


The COVID-19 pandemic was just the latest public health emergency to illuminate the value of health communication—and the need for skilled practitioners who can help the public cut through misinformation, conflicting messages, and changing guidelines in order to access reliable insight and advice. The next decade will be a transformative one in healthcare. According to a report by Hootsuite and We Are Social, the number of active social media users is in the billions—and growing exponentially. With more than half the world’s population using social media, and with such rapid and continued expansion, it is essential to harness the power of this tool in your healthcare marketing and communication efforts.


Savvy communicators, marketers, and brand strategists recognize the importance of effective storytelling and strategic social media practices in capturing the engagement and participation of patients, consumers, or desired target audiences. How those audiences and consumers experience initiatives through social media, websites, mobile apps, videos, and branded content can make or break the success of an otherwise well-defined health campaign or project.


BU MET’s Visual & Digital Health Communication certificate program introduces the fundamental principles of design and how to apply them to the creation of powerful health education and delivery application tools, such as infographics, data visualization graphics, videos, websites, mobile apps, and branded content. You will also examine how to effectively and responsibly leverage social media to connect with a variety of audiences and stakeholders.

Graduate Certificate in Visual & Digital Health Communication Curriculum

A total of four courses (16 units) is required, as follows:


MET HC 762
 Visual Communication in the Digital Health Age


Over the past two decades, the power of visuals in learning and retention has been increasingly recognized -- attributing as much as 80  of retention to information that is visually communicated. In a recent study, 85  of working professionals agreed that creative thinking is critical for problem solving in their career, and 71  say creative thinking should be taught as a course, like math and science. The efficacy of the use of visual symbols has also been recognized for bridging language barriers in health care settings. This course provides health communication professionals the fundamental principles of design and how these relate to effective communication, particularly in health education and delivery applications. Course lectures and resources will guide students from visual design theory, straight through content creation and measuring effectiveness of visual messaging. Students will explore various media and tools used to create digital images and get hands-on practice in the image editing process. Topics include conceptual design, critical thinking in the creation of practical design, how design relates to industry, human perception and the visual process, and the use of symbols for immediacy and to bridge cultural and literacy divides. In addition to exploring popular digital vehicles for visual storytelling, such as infographics, data visualization, video and mobile, the course will also present real- world challenges, such as ethics and regulations in digital communications, as well as business processes. Course requires access to a smartphone with camera and video capability or a digital camera/video. 
 Please note: This 4-credit course meets over a 7- week period. Students should expect about twice the weekly workload of a 14-week course.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET HC 763
 Social Media Strategies and Tactics for Healthcare


Fall  ‘25
The course examines how healthcare organizations are tapping the power of social media to listen, learn, engage and act. This course helps students understand the power and importance of this fundamental shift in communication, and how savvy health care organizations are turning this shift into a strategic advantage. Together, we will examine the impact of the communication technology revolution on the field of health marketing and communication. Through extensive readings, case studies, project assignments, hands-on use of social media and weekly discussions, students will explore the extraordinary health communication challenges and opportunities driven by social media -- as well as the new and daunting problems and threats social media present to healthcare organizations. Students will learn how social media is used in health care and why using it effectively and efficiently has become a necessary skill for many health care professionals. As part of this course, students have the opportunity to earn the Mayo-Hootsuite Social Media Basics Certification, and participate in the Mayo Clinic Social Media Network community.

 US Healthcare System


This course provides students with basic knowledge of how the health care system in the U.S. is structured, and the policies, stakeholders and complexities impacting access to care, costs, quality and equity among various populations. Drawing on multiple views and opinions, students build on their perspectives as they critically analyze pros and cons of health system fundamentals. Students then apply their knowledge to a series of practical written assignments that help build a strategic plan for improving the health outcomes of an underserved population in their home state. An emphasis is placed on written and oral delivery of final project campaigns.

MET HC 559
 Health Communication Principles and Strategies


Fall  ‘25
This foundational course examines and bridges the theory and practice of interpersonal, organizational, mass communication, and digital media relevant to the professional communicator and health practitioner alike. It reviews strategies of persuasion, the relationship between attitudes and health behavior through the lifespan, and the changing nature of health, illness and health delivery in local and global arenas. Students consider how the Social Determinants of Health (where we live, learn, work and play) impact health behaviors and outcomes for diverse populations. Starting with the history of health communication, students gain insight into the evolution of this emerging discipline, from public health education to its broader place in the marketing mix through recent decades. Guided by case studies, research and analysis, students explore the health communication cycle and strategic planning process using frames, channels and tools best suited for reaching behavioral, social, and organizational objectives. The course shifts from theoretical to practical, giving students hands-on experience developing a strategic health communication campaign that considers culture, age, gender and health literacy, to effectively -- and measurably -- influence health outcomes for its intended audience.

 Research Methods for Health Communication


There is a growing demand for professionals with the skills to collect, analyze and interpret data.

Students will practice analyzing, interpreting and writing about various health studies presented throughout the course. Also emphasized is the application of research to advertising messaging and public relations strategies.

 Writing for Health

If writing does not come naturally to you, this course will introduce you to those health literacy principles, as well as formats and processes for developing materials with confidence. If you're a more experienced writer, get ready to hone your skills using best practices for creating various kinds of health content. Throughout the course you'll analyze different audience needs and refine writing strategies, style, voice, and vocabulary to accommodate each audience. You'll also practice essential writing qualities, including clarity and brevity, alongside advanced grammar, sentence structure and writing mechanics. Assignments include writing, revising, and editing clear, accurate, audience-appropriate content for a journalistic news report; a patient education print brochure; narrative feature storytelling; a health-related blog; scriptwriting for a visual public service announcement, and social media writing to promote your content
