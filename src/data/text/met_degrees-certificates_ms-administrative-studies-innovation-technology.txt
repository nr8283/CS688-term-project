Advance Your Career with a Degree in Business Innovation


Innovation and the use of digital technologies are essential strategies to change a business model and provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities, especially in the current business world. The Administrative Studies master’s degree is focused on equipping you to meet these new business administration challenges. It is best suited to those who have gained an understanding of their profession’s general skills and abilities, and who are seeking advanced specialized education to confront current business administration challenges. It is important to note that because of the program’s specialized nature, it is different in its goal and scope from a master’s degree in business administration (the MBA), which is designed to provide individuals with a general overview of management skills and abilities. Because of the differences in design and intent, courses in Boston University’s MBA and MSAS programs are generally not transferable.
