Advance Your Career with a Master’s in Applied Data Analytics


With data analytics needs influencing every major industry—including healthcare, tech, finance, communication, entertainment, energy, transportation, government, and manufacturing, to name some—there is significant growth in specialized data science, data engineering, automation, AI, and machine learning areas. Yet the demand for skilled talent continues to outpace supply. QuantHub research confirms a shortfall of 250,000 data scientists in 2020, while McKinsey Global Institute anticipates as much as 12 percent annual growth in demand for graduates from data science programs over the next decade.


To harness the potential of this big data revolution, you need advanced techniques.


As a graduate of the MS in Applied Data Analytics program at BU MET, you will be able to demonstrate the ability to create powerful predictions through modeling and machine learning, and drive critical business decisions—skills needed to excel in a growing list of roles such as data scientist, economist, data analyst, business intelligence analyst, systems analyst, chief analytics officer, analytics manager, marketing analyst, business analyst, or financial analyst, among others.

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
