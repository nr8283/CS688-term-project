A Step-by-Step Guide to Registration






















Course registration should be completed online for all students, with the exception of some Boston University employees who must enroll using a paper form (instructions below).


Step-by-Step Registration Instructions


Below find specific instructions for newly admitted degree- and certificate-seeking students, new non-degree-seeking students, returning students, and BU employees.


New Students: Non-Degree


Just taking courses?
 If you have neither applied nor been admitted to Metropolitan College, you are welcome to take MET courses as a non-degree student.


To register for a course as a non-degree-seeking student for the first time, add courses to your wishlist 
here
 and complete the subsequent registration webform. After completing the registration webform, you will be brought back to your wishlist to add the course(s) to your schedule and complete your registration.


An hour after completing registration, you should receive an email with instructions to setup your BU login and Kerberos account. System processing of your account setup will take approximately 12 hours, after which you will be able to again access the portal. If you have not received any confirmation email within 48 hours, please contact 
metess@bu.edu
 for assistance.






Newly Admitted Students: Degree and Certificate Programs

Incoming students seeking to register for their first semester should follow the course registration process outlined below, or watch our 
Course Registration Tutorial video
. 
Please be sure to consult with your academic advisor prior to registering for courses.




Log in to 
MyBU Student Portal
 using your BU email and Kerberos password.



If you have not yet established your BU account, please refer to the instructions you received from “ithelp@bu.edu” upon accepting your admission offer. Contact us at 
metadmit@bu.edu
 if you have any questions.






Upon logging in, click on the 
Registration
 tile and you will be directed to your MyBU Student Dashboard.


From the Dashboard, click “Class Search” on the lefthand navigation to filter for courses based on specific criteria (term, instructor, course number, instruction mode, etc.). 
Watch this video tutorial
 for further guidance on utilizing Class Search and the course registration process.



Please note the following details when registering:



Use the “Instruction Mode” filter to select in-person or online courses.


Each term (semester) contains one 15-week on-campus session or two seven-week online sessions (most online courses are seven weeks in duration). Utilize the “Session” filter for online courses offered in “Seven Week – First” or “Seven Week – Second,” for online session 1 and online session 2 respectively.


A course “Status” with a green “O” label indicates the course has open seats. A course status indicating “10/35” indicates the course has 10 remaining open seats.










Once you have identified the course(s) you want to register for, click the “Enroll” button.
