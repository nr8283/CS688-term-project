Do you have an analytical mind and enjoy working with financial theory? A career as an actuary may be ideal for you. BU’s Metropolitan College (MET) offers the only MS in Actuarial Science degree program in New England—available on campus and online—teaching you how to put big data into context and preparing you for a coveted career that is consistently found at the top of “best jobs” lists. BU MET’s Actuarial Science master’s degree includes concentrations in 
Finance
 and 
Insurance
; we also offer four-course graduate certificate programs designed to help you “think like an actuary.”


Actuaries work for life, health, and property/casualty insurance companies, as well as for consulting firms, government agencies, accounting firms, industrial corporations, banks, and financial services companies. They use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory, defining the financial impact of uncertain events—from catastrophes to rates of mortality, disability, and retirement—allowing businesses to adjust their long-term management strategies accordingly.


Whether on campus or online, actuarial science students at BU MET learn from experienced faculty, getting exposure to practical business and economic principles, and exploring some of the fiscal and ethical dilemmas often encountered in the process of business decision-making. As practitioners in the Boston area, BU MET faculty provide a valuable network in one of the nation’s major financial and insurance centers. They’ll help you build a solid academic foundation in actuarial science, statistics, and finance, as you benefit from practical exposure to business and economic principles.


BU’s Actuarial Science program has the 
Society of Actuaries’ “UCAP-AC” designation
 and BU has Bronze Level recognition from the 
Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) University Recognition Program
 for demonstrated commitment to preparing future property and casualty actuaries through its educational offerings.









Society of Actuaries’ “UCAP-AC” designation
