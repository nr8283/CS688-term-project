Additional Information for On-Campus International Students




We are very excited to welcome you to Boston University—located in the heart of Boston, one of the great student cities of the world! Now that you have been admitted to Metropolitan College, the MET admissions team will guide you through the student visa application process. To apply for a student visa, you must first obtain a Certificate of Eligibility from Boston University. There are two types of certificates: the Form I-20 (for those seeking an F-1 visa) and the Form DS-2019 (for those seeking a J-1 visa). Obtaining a certificate is the first step towards securing your student visa, as you will need the certificate to schedule your visa appointment at a US consulate in your home country.


For a comprehensive overview of this process, please watch the video tutorial 
Applying for a US Visa
. While you are watching the tutorial, we encourage you to review this 
PDF of the presentation
, which contains active hyperlinks to all web pages referenced throughout the video. If you have visa-related questions, please contact us at 
metvisa@bu.edu
.
