Enter the World of Commercial Theater Development


In partnership with Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment, the Arts Administration program at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) offers a graduate certificate program in Commercial Theater Development in two formats:




The four-course 
Graduate Certificate in Commercial Theater Development
 (16 units) is available online and on campus.


The six-course 
Advanced Graduate Certificate in Commercial Theater Development
 (20 units) includes a semester-long internship opportunity on Broadway. All courses except the internship are available online and on campus. (Note: international students must attend on campus.)




Both versions of the Commercial Theater Development certificate are designed to train arts professionals who wish to work in the commercial performing arts. 
Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment

Nederlander companies
, which own and operate some of the world’s greatest theaters. They also produce and present premier entertainment and serve as consultants and talent bookers both for their own facilities and other renowned entertainment venues in the US and abroad.


The BU MET Commercial Theater Development graduate certificate program provides early and mid-career performing arts professionals with the opportunity to gain in-depth training in the development and production of commercial performing arts productions. Classes are taught at Boston University by leading practitioners from New York’s Broadway theater industry and include site visits to New York City where you will interact with leading figures in the commercial art world. Gain skills in managing commercial arts venues, securing and developing commercial productions, engaging with new technologies and innovative partnerships, and programming performing arts productions.


Those in the six-course Advanced Graduate Certificate in Commercial Theater Development will also have a valuable opportunity to complete an intensive internship with a commercial performing arts enterprise in either the US or international market.


The graduate certificate and advanced graduate certificate are open to both domestic and international applicants, and can be completed in a single calendar year. Commercial Theater Development certificate courses are also open to students enrolled in the

“I have started working at the Broadway Education Alliance, helmed by Susan Lee, who teaches Current Trends in the Performing Arts Industry (MET AR 753). While it isn't a permanent placement, it has allowed me to directly engage the skills I learned in the program in the larger arts community. It's given me a title that makes me more marketable and has put me in the room with several industry leaders in the business I want to transition into!”
