Orientation














Welcome to Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET)! To help you prepare for this exciting educational journey, we offer orientation events for admitted undergraduate and graduate students within the first week of the start of your program. These events introduce important information and valuable resources available at BU, so please plan to join us.


Admitted On-Campus Graduate Student Orientation


The Metropolitan College Graduate Student Orientation is offered to all admitted, 
on-campus
 graduate degree students.


During the on-campus student orientation, we will go over academic expectations for graduate students, explain general BU resources, introduce you to BU MET and your graduate program, and give you the opportunity to meet your classmates. Please note:




International students studying on-campus
 will receive an email from the 
International Student & Scholars Office (ISSO)
 about an additional orientation.


Most graduate departments and degree programs
 will invite you separately to program-specific meetings.




2025 Orientation Schedule for new on-campus graduate students:




Fall 2025 Orientation
 will be held on campus the morning of Tuesday, September 2, 2025. More information will be made available to admitted students via email in July 2025.




For any questions regarding orientation, please email 
met@bu.edu

Admitted Online Graduate Student Orientation


All new online graduate students will be invited to an online orientation held via Zoom just ahead of the start of your first semester. If you are unable to attend, event recordings will be made available to you. More information will be provided to admitted students via email a few weeks before the start of your first semester.

The 
Fall 2025 Orientation
 will be held virtually (via Zoom) on Wednesday, August 27 at 5:30 pm Eastern.
