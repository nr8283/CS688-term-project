 Actionable Sustainability

Sustainability generally refers to the ability of "systems" to be maintained such that they remain viable over long periods of time.

This course is intended for a wider audience from a range of disciplines.  [ 4 cr. ]

How Much Does This Program Cost?


BU MET programs offer the flexibility of part-time or full-time study, either on campus or online. Tuition, fees, and total program cost are determined by enrollment status. If you enroll in 1–2 courses (4–8 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
part-time per-unit rate
. If you enroll in 3–4 courses (12–16 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
full-time semester rate

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
