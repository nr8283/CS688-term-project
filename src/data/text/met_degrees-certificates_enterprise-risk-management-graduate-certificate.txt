Learn Valuable Risk Management Principles


Available online and on campus, the Graduate Certificate in Enterprise Risk Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) designed to provide business managers and public employees with the skills they need to formulate and execute the best possible response to a wide range of emergencies and disasters—from extreme weather to layoffs to a supply chain disruption.


The Enterprise Risk Management certificate provides expertise in the proactive aspects of planning and strategy, as well as the reactive aspects of crisis management and enterprise and organizational continuity. You will examine a range of technical and logistical issues facing emergency management professionals, while focusing on understanding the psychological and social components—the human resources—of an organization. In addition, you will learn the following principles:




Preparedness planning


Risk assessment and mitigation


The interface between private and public response


The human, technological, and logistical factors of crisis recovery


The development of a system-wide continuity plan




Each course in the Enterprise Risk Management certificate features a case-study simulation that provides an opportunity to apply the concepts learned from coursework under emergency-like conditions.
