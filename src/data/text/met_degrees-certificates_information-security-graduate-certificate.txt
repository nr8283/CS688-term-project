Learn Cybersecurity Skills to Guard Valuable Digital Information


Available on campus, online, and in a blended format, the Graduate Certificate in Information Security at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides the skills to develop and implement a strong IT security program within the organization. According to a recent report from Cybersecurity Ventures, it is predicted that there will be 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs in 2021, and not enough talent to fill them. 
MIT Technology Review
 asserts that fewer than one in four candidates for such jobs are qualified for the work.


BU MET’s graduate certificate program in Information Security can provide the specific skills you need to protect organizational information from cyber attacks that include unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction—and help avoid loss of business, lawsuits, and even bankruptcy.


From government agencies and hospitals to insurance companies and private businesses, organizations rely upon technology systems and smart devices to operate. With that much digital presence, the risk of a cybersecurity breach is significant—and the amount of critical or confidential information that is vulnerable to hackers, thieves, and other malicious players continues to increase. BU MET’s Information Security certificate introduces various aspects of cybersecurity, including IT security policies and system security. You will learn about digital forensics to help in investigating a security breach, and obtain a good understanding of how information is stored in a database and what services are available to protect it. We will also cover standards and laws, such as HIPPA, PCI, and GLBA, which help protect confidentiality and privacy of customer data.
