Improve Urban Policy through Effective Data Analysis


Though they may not always have the words “data” or “analyst” in their job titles, professionals in urban planning and policy are, in fact, immersed in data. As the trend towards evidence-based decision-making continues, government agencies, foundations, nonprofits, and planning firms all recognize the importance of leveraging data to create effective policy decisions and urban plans. However, the ability to analyze large and complex datasets can be challenging for those without specialized training.


Ideal for those who want to examine urban issues using existing and emerging forms of data, the Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides hands-on experience with valuable analytic and computational tools while developing the key skills needed to work with varied data sources that can serve to inform policy decisions in a range of government, nonprofit, and private organizations.


The Applied Urban Informatics certificate offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that is designed to prepare professionals to confront major issues affecting urban communities, including impacts upon vulnerable populations, economic development, infrastructure systems, and policy implementation. Students with this certificate will be able to identify urban challenges and use the informatics toolkit to derive actionable insights from data.

Track Record: 
Learn from the best—BU MET has been offering a master’s program in Urban Affairs since 1969. The master’s program in City Planning was introduced in 1976.




Learn to Solve Challenges in Planning, Urban Management, and Public Policy


The Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics is offered through BU MET’s Department of Applied Social Sciences, which oversees several graduate programs focusing on the challenges of the urban environment, including the 
Master of Science in City Planning (MSCP)
, the 
Master of Science in Urban Affairs (MSUA)
, the 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Sustainability
, and the 
Graduate Certificate in Urban Policy & Planning
.


BU’s City Planning & Urban Affairs programs prepare future leaders, practitioners, and innovators for the myriad challenges that arise in urban planning and policymaking. Students consider the political, social, and technical implications of each facet of planning and policymaking, and thus grapple with the fact that there are few, if any, simple solutions or approaches to urban issues.


Graduates can pursue a wide range of professional careers in town, city, and regional planning; sustainable management; community and economic development; transportation planning; public-sector/nonprofit management; and policy research, among others.


Graduate with Expertise


Boston University’s Applied Urban Informatics graduate certificate will equip you to:




Identify urban challenges in the sphere of planning, policy, and operations, with a particular focus on equity, economic, and environmental issues, while critically analyzing the ethical implications of emerging technologies used in addressing these challenges.


Utilize the informatics toolkit to define and address specific challenges and to derive actionable insight from data.


Incorporate data analysis results into urban planning and policy decisions to increase the quality of life for residents and support city government.


Communicate results clearly and effectively in a medium appropriate to the project, without relying on jargon.




Access to Analytics Laboratories


As a student in BU MET’s Applied Urban Informatics program, you have free access to hands-on analytics preparatory laboratories Introduction to R for Business (ADR 100) and Introduction to Python (ADPY 100). These labs are required for those without a background in R or Python.


Certificate-to-Degree Pathway

Master of Science in Urban Affairs
 or 
Master of Science in City Planning
 degree programs. Students currently enrolled in a graduate certificate who are interested in transitioning into a master’s degree should contact their academic advisor to declare their interest in this pathway. A new master’s degree application is not required. Connect with a graduate admissions advisor at 
apssadmissions@bu.edu
 to learn more about this option.




Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics Curriculum

A total of four courses (16 units) is required, as follows:


MET UA 591
 Applied Analytical Methods


Fall  ‘25
Evidence-based and data-driven approaches to urban problems are the industry standard among municipalities, agencies, and non-governmental organizations. This course will cover a variety of statistical "tools" from three broad areas: (1) descriptive statistics, (2) inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, and (3) measures of association. Students will learn how to develop research questions, describe, and draw conclusions from quantitative data, and interpret statistical research findings, and be able to present these findings to a variety of audiences in a clear and accurate way -- to be able to "tell a story" with numbers. In addition, students will develop a proficiency working with large data sets and conducting analysis with a critical lens, using the analytical software -- Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) -- commonly used in urban planning and related fields.  [ 4 cr. ]
