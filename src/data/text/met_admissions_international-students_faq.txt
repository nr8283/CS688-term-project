BU Community & Boston


What is the weather like in Boston? How should I prepare for the climate?
Boston is lucky to experience all four seasons, so it is important to be prepared for a variety of conditions. The weather can range from quite cold in the winter to hot and humid in the summer. Spring brings warm weather and a variety of flowering plants, while the fall is iconic for beautifully colorful foliage. Helpful information on the extremes of summer and winter are available on the 
Surviving Boston Weather
 web page.


Tips and what to expect for each season:


Winter (December-March)




The climate can be quite cold with snow and ice during the winter months.


It is important to wear warm clothing to stay comfortable when it is cold outside:



A warm, insulated jacket with a thick lining


Waterproof, insulated boots


A warm hat or beanie that covers your ears


Gloves or mittens


Wearing layers, such as a sweater or cardigan or fleece-lined leggings, can help you stay warmer and will give you flexibility as temperatures fluctuate.






Be careful walking when roads and sidewalks are icy – it can be slippery!


If you plan to drive during the winter, you will need a windshield scraper to clean snow off your car.




Spring (March-June)




Spring weather is typically mild.


Lighter layers are recommended as temperatures may fluctuate during the day.


Spring can be rather rainy, so it is good to be prepared with rainboots, a rain jacket with a hood, and an umbrella.




Summer (June-September)




Summer can be quite hot in the Boston area. It is important to stay hydrated during the summer months.


Using a fan or air conditioner, if possible, can help you stay cool.


Many coffee shops, public libraries, and shopping centers are air conditioned during the summer.


The summer is a great time to visit the ocean. Read the 
BU Today
 article
 about beaches that are accessible via public transportation for a great list of Greater Boston Beaches, and 
this article on free, publicly accessible pools
.




Fall: (September-December)




Fall, or autumn, is known for vibrant foliage. This is a great time to try typical New England activities like apple picking or hiking.


Fall weather starts to get chilly, so it is good to wear layers and a lighter jacket.








Where can I find places to eat in and around Boston? What kinds of food are typically available at and around the University?
Whether you have a dining plan on campus or plan to cook at home, Boston offers a rich and diverse culinary scene. Find information about on-campus dining options, ranging from sushi, salads, sandwiches, treats and comfort food, by reading 
Where to Eat
. A great list of popular restaurants to try near campus is available on

BU Today
 articles

How safe is the BU campus?  What about the city of Boston?
Boston University has many resources to foster a safe and secure community. The 
Office of Safety, Security & Preparedness
 offers proactive engagement and inclusive support. The university also offers safety measures including 
blue light emergency call boxes
 on campus, the 
BU Alert notification system
, and 
Scarlet Safe Walk
, a late-night walking escort service on the Charles River campus. The 
Boston University Police Department
 also offers safety resources including 
self-defense classes,
 a 
fraud prevention guide
, and 
safety tips and resources
.






Housing: on campus or off campus? What are the advantages and disadvantages and why?
On-Campus Housing:


To be eligible for on-campus graduate housing on the Charles River Campus, you must be enrolled as a full-time degree-seeking student and have your BU Kerberos username and password. All on-campus apartments are 
furnished
 with a full-size mattress, bed frame, desk, chair and dresser. Utilities – gas, heat, water, electricity – are provided, and 
Wi-Fi
 is included in monthly rent. With over 750 washers and dryers on campus, you will be sure to find one either in the residence or close by. 


Graduate residences (other than the 850 Beacon Street location) include either a private or shared kitchen as well. 


Graduate Residence Life Office
 and Facilities Management & Operations Staff are available for maintenance requests and support in on-campus residences. 


There is an application process for graduate on-campus housing. Students are assigned a timeslot based on application submission date and space availability. BU Housing cannot guarantee preferred unit availability, and you cannot switch your assignment after signing for a unit. Information on the 
graduate housing application process
 is available on the BU Housing website.


Off-Campus Housing:


BU students, faculty, staff, and alums have access to the resources available through 
BU Off-Campus Services
. This service can help you learn about apartment listings, short-term housing options, find roommates, and learn about signing a lease. While it is possible to find a furnished apartment or sublease, you may need to provide furnishings for your off-campus rental unit. You will also likely need to arrange for Wi-Fi and utilities.  We recommend that you start your off-campus apartment search early—up to four months before your planned arrival date. You will also need to be sure to read your lease carefully as it is a binding contract. Here are 
ten things to consider when signing a lease
.


Living off-campus can be a great way to engage with the 
unique neighborhoods
 around the Boston Area. If you are living farther from campus, you will need to consider transportation to and from campus. Learn more about all things “
Transportation
” including the subway system (the “T”), bus routes, the BU Shuttle Bus, and rideshare options.






Do you have any recommendations on affordable off-campus living areas near BU?
BU’s 
Off Campus Services
 is a great resource for finding apartments near campus. You can learn more about 
neighborhoods
 close to the university. Popular locations for off-campus housing include 
Allston
, 
Brighton
, and 
Fenway-Kenmore Square
.






What are the ways to select and rent an apartment?
Check out BU’s 
Off Campus Services
 to get started with your apartment search. If possible, it is a good idea to try to visit a property before signing a lease. If it is not feasible to visit in person, you can request a virtual tour or ask for a video walk-through. It is also important to know how to avoid 
scams and fraud
 when searching for an apartment. 


You should also read through the City of Boston’s list of 
top ten things tenants should know before signing a lease
. 


When applying for an apartment, you will need checks (not cash) and photo identification. You may also need your enrollment verification or letter of acceptance, former landlord letter, proof of good credit, and guarantor or co-signer. Learn more about 
renting essentials
