Master Global Supply Chain Logistics


The 
Master of Science in Supply Chain Management (MSSCM)
 concentration in Logistics Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides a solid foundation in the qualitative and quantitative methods used by logistics and transportation managers of complex global supply chains. Specifically, the MSSCM Logistics Management concentration will emphasize decision-making in the areas of transportation management, warehouse and distribution center operations, import/export operations, and international trade and logistics.


With its disruption of so many moving parts, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical and complex nature of logistics in global supply chains. A 2020 supply chain survey by Capgemini Research Institute shows that a significant majority of organizations—77 percent—are accelerating their investments in supply chain sustainability initiatives over the next three years, focusing on logistics and manufacturing. In their 2023 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a graduate degree is $113,300. In addition, the career satisfaction is high with 96% professionals planning to stay in the field in the following five years.

Advance Your Career in Supply Chain Management


Offered online and on campus, BU MET’s Logistics Management concentration in the Supply Chain Management master’s degree focuses on how to analyze alternative inventory, storage, and distribution networks using mathematical and statistical tools to forecast demand, calculate safety stock, consider inventory aggregation, compare alternative transportation modes, and evaluate operational risks. Learn the foundations of international trade, import/export regulations, international tariffs, and other global trade mechanisms, as well as systematic process-oriented approaches to evaluating supply chain performance using statistical modeling with Six Sigma principles and techniques. By including insight into the management of performance and exposure to the coordination of large-scale projects, you will be well-equipped to take your place among today’s supply chain leaders. Capstone projects provide an opportunity to work on real-world business problems for prominent client firms while resources such as the 
Decision Sciences Research Laboratory
 connect you to the supply chain industry through collaborative applied research.


According to the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), supply chain jobs—including high-tech roles in data analysis, cloud solutions, supply chain planning, and risk management—are projected to grow in line with the national average of 9 percent over the course of the next decade. In their 2021 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a master’s degree is $99,900, and that 95 percent kept their jobs during the pandemic. In addition, one third of respondents reported finding a job in less than a month.
