Advance Your Career with a Master’s in Computer Information Systems


In 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 467,361 complaints, with losses exceeding $3.5 billion. The number of complaints since 2015 is close to 2 million, with $10 billion in losses. From email compromises, phishing scams, and ransomware to corporate data breaches or even cyberterrorism, businesses face unprecedented threats from cybercriminals.


Having information security systems in place to protect the assets of the organization, employees, and clients is essential. The BU MET master’s in Computer Information Systems concentration in Security positions you for exciting careers protecting organizations against acts of cybercrime. Roles such as information security analyst are expected to surge through 2028, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, with much faster than average job growth of 32 percent and median annual salaries in excess of $90K. There remains, however, a significant talent gap as organizations scramble to employ and retain qualified cybersecurity engineers, cybersecurity analysts, cybersecurity consultants, cybersecurity managers/administrators, cybersecurity architects, and others.

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
