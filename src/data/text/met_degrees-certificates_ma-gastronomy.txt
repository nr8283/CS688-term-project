Make a Difference in the Future of Food Studies


The decade ahead is a critical time for those devoted to the study of food. While the the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating to the food industry, its challenges were countered by a wave of innovation. Experimentation with contactless experiences and technology-driven systems in food service, repurposing streets and sidewalks for al fresco dining, new approaches to food delivery and supply chains, and a rise in sustainable urban agriculture have changed the ways humans interact with food, with each other, and with traditions based inside the home and via online communities.


On a deeper, ongoing level, the food industry is also confronting the pernicious legacy of institutional racism, recognizing that bias has permeated food business practices, culinary research, and cookbooks and other media over time. By recognizing the omission of diverse cultures and voices, those in the field of gastronomy can play a role in changing the course of history through inclusion and the amplification of experiences and stories that have otherwise been ignored and overlooked—enriching the field and providing a more accurate picture of food and the role it plays in culture.


The master’s degree in Gastronomy at BU MET is an opportunity be at the forefront of these important societal changes as a critical thinker who can research and document contemporary and historical issues through the lens of food and food customs. Graduates of the program will see new careers developing in the field that reflect historical social changes and civil rights practices, and will be well-positioned to take on challenging new roles.


Available on campus and online, Boston University’s Master of Arts in Gastronomy program offers a rigorous, interdisciplinary approach to food studies that pairs opportunities for experiential learning in culinary arts laboratories, wine studies courses, and classroom lab activities with a core curriculum based in the liberal arts. You will hone the critical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills necessary to tackle today’s complex food issues, while developing a deep understanding of food in the context of arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences.


The interplay of research, reading, and writing about food, combined with the process of exploring food through the senses, gives the program exceptional depth. You will engage with distinguished scholars and academic departments across BU’s many schools and colleges, as well as with renowned visiting faculty and notable food industry professionals and thought leaders—developing the practical and theoretical expertise required for working in food-related industries, governance, and non-profit organizations.

“What was great about my time in the Gastronomy program was how interdisciplinary it was. We learned about various aspects of the industry—from anthropology, to history, to the senses—and I also took food marketing classes. We got a better understanding of the industry as a whole. And now I’m able to use that to understand how consumers interact with their food when I’m advising entrepreneurs on what their packaging and product will mean to a consumer.”

 History of Food


Fall  ‘25
History is part of a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to food studies. Knowing where our food comes from chronologically is just as important as knowing where it comes from geographically. Historical forces bring our food to the table and shape the agricultural practices, labor arrangements and cultural constructions that make meals possible. We will read, research and write food history to explore the ways in which the history of food has shaped our world today, paying careful attention to structural inequalities that restrict food access. We will examine ways in which contemporary questions and problems inform historical inquiries and vice versa. Readings and projects in this course will typically focus on one geographic region but as a class we will be taking into account global connections and influences. The course material is organized both chronologically and thematically, with subthemes such as race, urbanization and industrialization. Students will learn about historical methodology and apply it to their own research.   [ 4 cr. ]

MET ML 614
 Philosophy of Food


"Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are."-- Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826) In this course, we will use the tools of the philosopher to study various aspects of food--its classification, preparation, consumption, and judgments about the practices affected by it. The focus in this course will be how philosophers contribute to food studies through engagement with long-standing philosophical questions--not just in aesthetics, moral and political philosophy, but also in metaphysics and epistemology. Topics addressed in the class may include foods as natural (or non-natural) kinds; cultural knowledge, know-how and food traditions; eating and identity; eating, rationality and norms; vegetarianism and moral philosophy; and neuroscience, culture and taste.   [ 4 cr. ]

MET ML 619
 The Science of Food and Cooking


Cooking is chemistry, and it is the chemistry of food that determines the outcome of culinary undertakings. In this course, basic chemical properties of food are explored in the context of modern and traditional cooking techniques. The impact of molecular changes resulting from preparation, cooking, and storage is the focus of academic inquiry. Illustrative, culturally specific culinary techniques are explored through the lens of food science and the food processing industry. Examination of "chemistry-in- the-pan" and sensory analysis techniques will be the focus of hands-on in- class and assigned cooking labs.   [ 4 cr. ]




MET ML 623
 Food and Museums


Students will examine interpretive foodways programs from museums, living history museums, folklore/folklife programs, culinary tourism offerings, "historical" food festivals, and food tours to compare different approaches to public histories of food. Through several case studies, students will examine mission statements, interpretive goals, and different methods of communicating with the public. Guest lectures and field trips lay the groundwork for a final project in which students develop a proposal for an interpretive food history program for an area museum, tour program, or public history program. Course offers opportunities for focused inquiry, hands-on research, and creative thinking.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET ML 625
 Wild and Foraged Foods


Humans have been foraging for food since prehistoric times, but the recent interest in wild and foraged foods raises interesting issues about our connection to nature amid the panorama of industrially oriented food systems. From political economy to Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), this course explores how we interact with, perceive, and know our world through the procurement of food. Students take part in foraging activities and hands-on culinary labs in order to engage the senses in thinking about the connections between humans, food, and the environment.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET ML 626
 Food Waste: Scope, Scale, & Signals for Sustainable Change


Food waste is a hot topic but not a new one. Some wasted food is the sign of a healthy system-- if there were exactly enough calories produced to meet each of our needs, there would be mass starvation, riots, and hoarding as we all scrambled to get our share. But by some estimates, food loss and waste account for nearly 40 of the food produced. How much wasted food is too much' At the same time this food is wasted, food insecurity is everywhere, even on BU's campus. Is all wasted food "trash'" Need it be' Why is food wasted and where along the supply chain is it wasted' What are the ethics of donating surplus food/waste/trash of those who have too much to those who don't have enough' This hybrid course explores the history, culture, rhetoric, and practicalities of wasted food, from farm, through fork, to gut (is overeating a form of food waste' What about wasting micronutrients by converting them to ultraprocessed foods'). Each week includes readings, discussion, application activity; and several weeks will include a guest lecture from a food system practitioner. Students will develop practical solutions in a final project.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Culture and Cuisine of the African Diaspora


Fall  ‘25
The foodways of the people displaced from the African continent are interwoven with many societies, cultures, and cuisines across the globe. In this course, we will study five geographic regions of Africa; north, central, east, west and south. The list of the countries that encompass each region will follow. Cookbooks, maps, songs, poems, and even some folklore will be used as texts to analyze and add context to the history of the people of the diaspora. This course will have real, and courageous, and respectful conversations including race and power and how those two elements are embedded into the food systems in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Europe. We will trace ingredients that came with the enslaved people and track their integration into cuisines and cultures (agriculture, pop culture, aquaculture etc.) as a collective group and then independently as a capstone course project.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Cookbooks and History


Fall  ‘25
What can cookbooks and recipes tell us about an individual' A community' A culture' What does the language of the recipe say about systems of knowledge and ways of thinking about the world' The movement of ingredients and food technology' The transmission of cooking knowledge' Does the analysis of historical cookbooks have contemporary applications' In this course, students will consider these questions through a survey of historical cooking texts and in-class exercises. We will examine cookbooks as a source of culinary history and a window into the changing material culture, practices, spaces, and relationships associated with food preparation and consumption. In addition, students will examine cookbooks and recipes as social documents that reveal the presence of social and economic hierarchies, networks and alliances, and political, economic, and religious structures. We will also examine these documents as cultural texts that reveal the construction of ethnic, gendered, and other identities. Students will study and analyze a selection of cookbooks from different historical periods and geographic regions leading to a final project and paper.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Sociology of Taste


Fall  ‘25
Taste has an undeniable personal immediacy: producing visceral feelings ranging from delight to disgust. As a result, in our everyday lives we tend to think about taste as purely a matter of individual preference. However, for sociologists, our tastes are not only socially meaningful, they are also socially determined, organized, and constructed. This course will introduce students to the variety of questions sociologists have asked about taste. What is a need' Where do preferences come from' What social functions might our tastes serve' Major theoretical perspectives for answering these questions will be considered, examining the influence of societal institutions, status seeking behaviors, internalized dispositions, and systems of meaning on not only what we enjoy--but what we find most revolting.  [ 4 cr. ]
