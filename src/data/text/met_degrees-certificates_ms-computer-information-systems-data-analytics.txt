MET CS 555
 Foundations of Machine Learning


Fall  ‘25
Formerly titled CS 555 Data Analysis and Visualization with R. 
This course provides an overview of the statistical tools most commonly used to process, analyze, and visualize data. Topics include simple linear regression, multiple regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, and survival analysis. These topics are explored using the statistical package R, with a focus on understanding how to use and interpret output from this software as well as how to visualize results. In each topic area, the methodology, including underlying assumptions and the mechanics of how it all works along with appropriate interpretation of the results, are discussed. Concepts are presented in context of real world examples. Recommended Prerequisite: MET CS 544 or equivalent knowledge, or instructor's consent.  [ 4 cr. ]

***
Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
