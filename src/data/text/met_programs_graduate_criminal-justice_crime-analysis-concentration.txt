 Criminology and Crime Policy


Fall  ‘25
This course explores potential answers to complex and important questions about criminal behavior by drawing on the social science of criminology. Criminology is the interdisciplinary study of the development of law, criminal phenomena and societal responses to crime. The course has two primary focuses: 1) to explore and evaluate major explanations or theories of crime and 2) understand and evaluate the policy implications of major crime problems. Because criminology is interdisciplinary, students will examine theories that are grounded in a range of academic perspectives, including sociological, biological, political, psychological and economic explanations for crime. These theories will be centered on important public policy debates about a host of contemporary problems, including: firearm violence, high post- incarceration recidivism, opioid use disorder crisis and human trafficking. Course lectures and discussions focus on the historical development of the theories, their major assumptions and propositions, their relevance for public policy and practice. As the course progresses through each explanation for crime, students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate the validity of different explanations for crime as well as criminal justice policies and practices that they support.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Performance Management Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Data analysis informs administration, management and accountability processes within criminal justice and related organizations. While traditional crime analysis often narrowly seeks to improve the organization's effectiveness towards public safety outcomes, management and accountability analysis seeks to also ensure fair, efficient, transparent, and accountable practices as well. This course examines contemporary management and accountability practices with an emphasis on the ways in which data can be employed to improve these practices. Students will learn skills to work with real data sources across justice-system domains, from policing to corrections, as well as community-based organizations. Contemporary challenges, such as disparate treatment, abuse of force, 'overpolicing,' frame discussions and assignments. Students will understand the strengths and limitations of data-informed approaches. The course is valuable to students seeking careers in analytical roles, other practitioners, non-profit managers, and those interested in justice reform more broadly.   [ 4 cr. ]

 Threat Assessment


Fall  ‘25
Threat assessment is a systematic strategy for identifying, assessing, and preventing potential violent incidents. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining insights from criminology, law enforcement, psychiatry, and psychology, behavioral threat assessment is designed to provide alternatives to violence before an attack occurs. In this class, students will learn the principles of behavioral threat assessment and explore ongoing developments in the field by reviewing case examples and studies of school shooters, mass murderers, lone actor terrorists, as well as more common offender types such as domestic violence offenders. The course is intended for a wide variety of law enforcement officers, mental health practitioners, school administrators, workplace managers, and public officials who are charged with maintaining community safety.  [ 4 cr. ]
