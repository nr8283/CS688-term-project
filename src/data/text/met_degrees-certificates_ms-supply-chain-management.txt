Develop a Strategic Approach to Managing Supply Chains


Prepare to meet the challenges of today’s supply chains with the Master of Science in Supply Chain Management (MSSCM) degree program at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET). The following optional Supply Chain Management degree concentrations are available:


Concentrations




Analytics


Logistics Management


Risk Management




Over the past half century, the area of supply chain management has evolved from improving labor-intensive processes to developing, mobilizing, and managing complex global networks—driving growth and putting a premium on professionals with expertise in management of suppliers, acquisition of raw materials, transportation of goods, financial management, inventory planning, warehouse management, and managing flow of information.


At the same time, modern disruptions to global commerce and the supply chains that support it have underscored the need for robust, data analytics-driven supply chains that are agile, resilient, and sustainable.


According to the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), supply chain jobs—including high-tech roles in data analysis, cloud solutions, supply chain planning, and risk management—are projected to grow in line with the national average of 9 percent over the course of the next decade. In their 2023 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a graduate degree is $113,300. In addition, the career satisfaction is high with 96% professionals planning to stay in the field in the following five years.

Advance Your Career in Supply Chain Management


Offered online and on campus, the Supply Chain Management master’s degree program provides the analytical basis for the design, optimization, operation, and improvement of a global supply chain. The curriculum provides comprehensive coverage of quantitative tools to support decision-making in complex, ever-changing supply chain environments. These tools include time series data analytics, mathematical optimization, simulation, statistical and financial analysis, regression, lean methods, and control charting. The application of these tools supports capacity and inventory buffering, customer flow analysis, demand forecasting, risk assessment, queue modeling, quality assurance, and Six Sigma process improvement. Particular attention is given to recent tendencies in supply chain digitalization and sustainability efforts. Meanwhile, capstone projects provide an opportunity to work on real-world business problems for prominent client firms while resources such as the 
Decision Sciences Research Laboratory
 connect you to the supply chain industry through collaborative applied research. As a graduate of the MSSCM program, you will be able to analyze and improve business process flows and become a confident decision-maker who will lead change and offer creative solutions that ensure prompt delivery of goods and services in an ever-changing global environment.


Corporations such as McDonalds, Starbucks, Cisco, Coca Cola, Intel, Walmart, Nestle, BMW, Nike, Unilever, and Johnson & Johnson rely on sophisticated, expertly managed supply chains, as do startups and smaller firms.

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
