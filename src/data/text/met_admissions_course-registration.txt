Register for Courses














You don’t necessarily need to apply for a degree or certificate program—or submit transcripts—to take a Metropolitan College course on campus or online. All you have to do is register.


Generally, you can apply up to two eligible courses taken at MET toward a Metropolitan College degree program. Consult with the appropriate 
academic department or program office
 for eligibility and transfer guidelines.


Note: You must be 18 years of age or older to register for a Boston University Metropolitan College course during the fall and spring semesters.

“Learning at BU is a rewarding experience, and the coursework is very challenging. My professors have demanded my best work, and I apply many of my newly acquired skills daily in my career. Enrolling at Metropolitan College has been one of my wisest decisions.”
