If you wish to develop and pursue a course of study centered around a unifying theme, problem, or issue, the Bachelor of Science (BS)/Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS) in Interdisciplinary Studies degree programs at Boston University’s Metropolitan College provides an opportunity to propose your own curriculum and choose ten related upper-level courses (40 units), selected from various Metropolitan College departments and programs. Exposure to humanities, social and natural sciences, math, and computer science ensures that you develop college-level rhetorical acumen and critical-thinking skills.

Online Undergraduate Degree Completion Program (UDCP)
. For students who wish to complete their bachelor’s degree—and who have previously earned 52–64 transferable academic units—the Online UDCP offers a unique, completely online curriculum covering the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences.
