International Travel Study Courses


The Arts Administration program is committed to exposing its students to the growing impact of globalization on the art world. US students enrolled in the master’s program are required to take an international travel study course (international students are encouraged to do so as well). Using the resources of Boston University and its partnerships with other institutions abroad, recent courses have been offered in Barcelona, Spain; Dublin, Ireland; Brussels, Belgium; London, England; and Havana, Cuba. The Arts in Barcelona (MET AR 587) is offered during spring break and Comparative Cultural Policy and Administration (London/Brussels in 2024) (MET AR 577) is offered in the summer.


Internship


Students matriculating in the Arts Administration program are required to have direct work experience in arts organizations prior to degree conferral. There are two components to the internship course. Through the Internship I course (MET AR 802), students prepare to obtain an internship by honing their interviewing skills, conducting a job search, and working with a network of organizations and alumni to secure an appropriate placement. Students must have completed 24 units prior to taking Internship II (MET AR 803) and undertaking the actual fieldwork. The program maintains a formal relationship with a core group of potential host organizations that have been selected for their willingness to work with interns, although it is possible to intern with other organizations as well. The student is expected to complete a total of 150 hours of work with the host agency, generally within a single semester. 
Visit the 
Arts Administration website
 for detailed information.


Internship Waiver


Students with four or more years of professional arts organization work experience may waive the internship requirement with their advisor’s written consent. If the internship is waived, the student must enroll in a tenth classroom-based course. Students with at least two years of full-time professional arts administration work experience can substitute Advanced Management and Consulting for Arts Organizations (MET AR 804) for the internship with written consent from their advisor and permission from course instructors.

part-time per-unit rate
. If you enroll in 3–4 courses (12–16 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
full-time semester rate

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
