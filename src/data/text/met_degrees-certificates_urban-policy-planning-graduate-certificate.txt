Track Record: 
Learn from the best—BU MET has been offering a master’s program in Urban Affairs since 1969. The master’s program in City Planning was introduced in 1976.




Learn to Solve Challenges in Planning, Urban Management, and Public Policy


The Graduate Certificate in Urban Policy & Planning is offered through BU MET’s Department of Applied Social Sciences, which oversees several graduate programs focusing on the challenges of the urban environment, including the 
Master of Science in City Planning (MSCP)
, the 
Master of Science in Urban Affairs (MSUA)
, the 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Sustainability
, and the 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics
.


BU’s Urban Affairs & City Planning programs prepare future leaders, practitioners, and innovators for the myriad challenges that arise in urban planning and policymaking. Students consider the political, social, and technical implications of each facet of planning and policymaking, and thus grapple with the fact that there are few, if any, simple solutions or approaches to urban issues.


Graduates can pursue a wide range of professional careers in town, city, and regional planning; sustainable management; community and economic development; transportation planning; public-sector/nonprofit management; and policy research, among others.


Graduate with Expertise


Boston University’s Urban Policy & Planning graduate certificate will equip you to:




Critically analyze historical and contemporary urban planning frameworks, understanding their impact on urban development and policy-making.


Create strategic policy and planning solutions that incorporate the diverse perspectives of various stakeholder groups, including those of minority and disadvantaged communities.




Certificate-to-Degree Pathway


BU MET graduate certificate programs can serve as building blocks to a master’s degree. The Graduate Certificate in Urban Policy & Planning shares specific courses with the 
Master of Science in Urban Affairs
 and 
Master of Science in City Planning
 degree programs.
