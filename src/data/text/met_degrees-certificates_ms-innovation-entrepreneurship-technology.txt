 Python and SQL for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD100 - Python is a modern, high-level programming language. One of the most popular programming languages, its use has steadily increased across a large number of industries. This course introduces students to the Python environment and teaches a solid foundation in the basic syntax and structure. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most common language globally for interacting with relational databases. Employers have indicated that knowledge of SQL is one of the most important skills for new graduates entering the workforce. Even with advances in database technologies and languages for handling heterogeneous data types, SQL remains the core skill for interacting with data. This course introduces both languages to equip students pursuing an analytics education with the skills necessary to succeed in the analytics and data visualization field. The outcome of this course will be a focused survey of Python and SQL topics designed to equip analytics professionals rather than a deep focus on technical programming topics.  [ 4 cr. ]

How Much Does This Program Cost?


BU MET programs offer the flexibility of part-time or full-time study, either on campus or online. Tuition, fees, and total program cost are determined by enrollment status. If you enroll in 1–2 courses (4–8 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
part-time per-unit rate
. If you enroll in 3–4 courses (12–16 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
full-time semester rate

***
Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
