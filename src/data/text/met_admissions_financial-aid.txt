Metropolitan College Financial Aid














A Boston University education is within your reach. While financing a college education can appear challenging, BU’s Metropolitan College offers scholarships, loans, and assistantships to help you meet your educational goals. We also provide information to help you make thoughtful decisions about options for financing a Boston University education.


If, like many BU MET students, you are working either part-time or full-time while in your graduate program, we encourage you to speak with your employer regarding potential tuition benefits. Some companies offer tuition reimbursements, while others may offer direct payments. Additionally, Metropolitan College has over 200 
Preferred Educational Partners
 that offer tuition discounts. For more information, contact 
metcorp@bu.edu
.


Boston University also provides guidance on personal money management and loan repayment, including workshops and online resources. We encourage you to visit BU’s 
Smart Money 101 page
.
