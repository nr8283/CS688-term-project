Expand Your Foundation in Actuarial Science


Building upon concepts covered in the 
Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Foundations
, the Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Science at Boston University’s Metropolitan College further cultivates your ability to “think like an actuary” by developing problem-solving skills through exposure to a wide range of actuarial-related topics, notably interest theory and probability.


By completing the Actuarial Science graduate certificate, you will be able to work with complex actuarial models in insurance companies, consulting firms, and related industries.


Preparation for Professional Examinations


BU MET’s Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Science courses are designed to help you build an understanding of the subject matter while providing sufficient background to be successful in passing the following Society of Actuaries (SoA) exams: FAM, A-LTAM or A-STAM, and SRM. Passing these exams, and the units you will receive for successfully passing Mathematical Statistics (MET MA 582), will put you in a good position to receive an “Actuarial Science Foundations” micro-credential from the SoA. Students who follow the SoA exam track will typically work in fields such as life insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance, and pension plans, all of which use the probability of mortality.

Master the Tools of the Actuarial Science Profession


Metropolitan College will help you acquire the skills you need to become a successful actuary in today’s competitive job market. With the 
MS in Actuarial Science
 and its concentrations in 
Finance
 and 
Insurance
, along with the 
Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Foundations
 and Graduate Certificate in Actuarial Science, BU MET provides an excellent academic foundation and practical exposure to real-world business environments.


If you have an analytical mind and enjoy working with financial theory, a career as an actuary could be an excellent opportunity for you. Actuarial science uses a combination of statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, data science, and other fields to allow actuaries to make crucial policy decisions in an unpredictable business world. With this specialized knowledge comes enhanced compensation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median salary for recent actuarial science graduates is higher than the average for other professions. And, the 
BLS predicts a 23 percent increase
 in opportunities through 2032.


With a faculty made up of academic actuaries, practicing actuaries, and actuaries who have extensive real-world experience, BU MET’s programs in Actuarial Science help you develop the skills you need to become a credentialed actuary. You will gain a solid academic foundation through specialized courses in actuarial science, data science, finance, and related fields. You will also benefit from being exposed to current business and economic practices while examining the fiscal and ethical dilemmas encountered in the process of business decision-making.


Located in one of the nation’s top financial and insurance centers, Boston University is the only university in New England that offers a master’s degree in Actuarial Science, providing an unmatched environment to learn and to find both internships and full-time employment. BU’s Actuarial Science program has the 
Society of Actuaries’ “UCAP-AC” designation
 and BU has Bronze Level recognition from the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) 
University Recognition Program
 for demonstrated commitment to preparing future property and casualty actuaries through its educational offerings.
