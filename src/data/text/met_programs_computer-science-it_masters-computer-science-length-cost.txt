How Long Does a Master’s in Computer Science Take to Complete—and What is the Cost?
















Back to Programs
Computer Science & IT


Pursuing an education as an adult presents distinct challenges. How do you earn a graduate degree while tending to the demands of your profession, your family, and your limited free time? How do you afford it—and how big a bite will it take out of your time? At Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET), there are options that enable you to balance an education with the demands of life.


Master’s degree programs at BU’s Metropolitan College have been carefully designed to provide flexible modes of study within the parameters of a rigorous education. That means you have more control over how long you choose to take to complete a program, and whether to pursue it as a full-time or part-time student—a calculation that plays a role in how much a degree at BU MET might cost.


Take BU MET’s 
Master of Science in Computer Science
. A good percentage of our students work full time in the technology industry while pursuing their degree part-time, so they depend on a computer science curriculum that is both rigorous and flexible. These software developers, information security analysts, network administrators, database developers, data analysts, IT project managers, and health informatics professionals benefit from BU MET’s convenient evening courses and learn from expert faculty who understand the challenges of balancing an education with a demanding job and a home life. Meanwhile, invaluable industry connections are made in the classroom—one of the perks of studying alongside other working professionals.


BU MET has a long history—over half a century—supporting nontraditional learners from diverse walks of life in pursuit of their education. The College offers a variety of ways you can tailor your program to suit the needs and demands of your own life. Practically speaking, you can choose to enroll in courses offered during the fall, spring, and summer terms. Whether you pursue your course of study full-time or part-time is your choice, based on what works best for you.


How Many Years Will It Take to Earn a Computer Science Master’s at BU?


The short answer is that it depends. Will you pursue this evening computer science program part-time or full-time? Will you take courses every semester—spring, summer, and fall—or will you take a break from your studies between terms? At BU’s Metropolitan College, these are all decisions you can make based on what works best for you.


The 40-unit MS in Computer Science at Boston University can be completed in 12 months of full-time study, and as few as 20 months as a part-time student.


Owing to busy schedules, some part-time students require more flexibility than others, and may elect to take as much as six years to complete their master’s degree.

A BU Education is Within Reach


Metropolitan College was established at Boston University in 1965 in order to ensure that adult learners had access to a prestigious Boston University education though flexible learning options and affordable tuition. Many students at BU MET are working professionals; as such, they earn their degree or certificate while working part-time or full-time. That reality often dictates how much time a student can commit to graduate study each term. For those studying part-time, BU MET offers competitive tuition that brings a BU education within reach.


At the same time, Metropolitan College offers opportunities for full-time study for those who wish to commit as much time as possible to their courses each semester. Full-time options are also excellent for 
international students
 who must maintain F-1 visa status in order to study in the US.
