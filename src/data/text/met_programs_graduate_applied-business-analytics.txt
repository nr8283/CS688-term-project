Leading in the Age of Data and AI: Preparing the Next Generation of Analytics Professionals


In today’s business landscape, the convergence of artificial intelligence, real-time data infrastructure, and advanced analytics rapidly transforms decisions and value creation. The Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) prepares you for this next-generation ecosystem by providing a hands-on, immersive experience in turning data into actionable insights. 


As McKinsey outlines in 
The Data-Driven Enterprise of 2025
, leading organizations are embedding data into every decision, treating it as a core product, and leveraging it in real time to optimize processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive innovation. At the same time, the 
2025 State of Analytics Engineering Report
 emphasizes that AI is augmenting, not replacing, data professionals, fundamentally reshaping their roles and catalyzing massive investments in tools, quality, and trust across the data lifecycle. Our program is designed to equip future managers, analysts, and consultants with the mindset and capabilities demanded by these changes, where AI fluency, data literacy, and a deep understanding of data governance, ethics, and cloud infrastructure are no longer optional, but foundational.

Advance Your Career in Applied Business Analytics


The rapid integration of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics into business operations is transforming the expectations for today’s professionals. Data team budgets and headcounts are growing significantly, and 80 percent of professionals already use AI tools in their daily workflows—not to replace human insight, but to augment it. This shift is creating a surge in demand for analytics-enabled professionals who can combine industry expertise with fluency in data and AI. Meanwhile, data will be embedded in every decision, interaction, and process, requiring business leaders to treat data as a product and AI as a core enabler of strategy. Yet despite these advances, a persistent talent gap remains: organizations urgently need professionals who can bridge business context with technical skill.


To help close this gap, Boston University’s Metropolitan College offers the Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics, available both on campus and online. The program is designed for professionals looking to lead in the next wave of innovation by harnessing data, AI, and advanced analytics to drive strategic outcomes across industries. Graduates of the program have gone on to work at organizations such as Google, Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Viacom, State Street, and Fidelity.

 Business Analytics Foundations


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: AD100 Pre-Analytics Laboratory
This course presents fundamental knowledge and skills for applying business analytics to managerial decision-making in corporate environments. Topics include descriptive analytics (techniques for categorizing, characterizing, consolidating, and classifying data for conversion into useful information for the purposes of understanding and analyzing business performance), predictive analytics (techniques for detection of hidden patterns in large quantities of data to segment and group data into coherent sets in order to predict behavior and trends), prescriptive analytics (techniques for identification of best alternatives for maximizing or minimizing business objectives). Students will learn how to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable analytics-based decisions. The framework of using interlinked data inputs, analytics models, and decision-support tools will be applied within a proprietary business analytics shell and demonstrated with examples from different functional areas of the enterprise.

 Python and SQL for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD100 - Python is a modern, high-level programming language. One of the most popular programming languages, its use has steadily increased across a large number of industries. This course introduces students to the Python environment and teaches a solid foundation in the basic syntax and structure. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most common language globally for interacting with relational databases. Employers have indicated that knowledge of SQL is one of the most important skills for new graduates entering the workforce. Even with advances in database technologies and languages for handling heterogeneous data types, SQL remains the core skill for interacting with data. This course introduces both languages to equip students pursuing an analytics education with the skills necessary to succeed in the analytics and data visualization field. The outcome of this course will be a focused survey of Python and SQL topics designed to equip analytics professionals rather than a deep focus on technical programming topics.  [ 4 cr. ]

MET AD 699
 Data Mining for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD571
Enterprises, organizations, and individuals are creating, collecting, and using a massive amount of structured and unstructured data with the goal of converting the information into knowledge, improving the quality and the efficiency of their decision-making process, and better positioning themselves in the highly competitive marketplace. Data mining is the process of finding, extracting, visualizing, and reporting useful information and insights from both small and large datasets with the help of sophisticated data analysis methods. It is part of business analytics, which refers to the process of leveraging different forms of analytical techniques to achieve desired business outcomes through requiring business relevancy, actionable insight, performance management, and value management. The students in this course will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining. They will learn how to apply advanced models and software applications for data mining. Finally, students will learn how to examine the overall business process of an organization or a project with the goal of understanding (i) the business context where hidden internal and external value is to be identified and captured, and (ii) exactly what the selected data mining method does. Python, R, SQL, and Power BI software are used in this course.  [ 4 cr. ]
