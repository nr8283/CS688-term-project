International Student Tuition & Fees














Thank you for your interest in attending Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET)! On this page you will find important information about financing your education at BU.


International graduate students are not eligible for scholarships or federal financial assistance, but may consider applying for graduate assistantships or 
private loans
 after being offered admission.  


Tuition


View the 
full-time status tuition rates
 and 
how to pay
.


If you are planning to study at BU MET on an F-1 visa, you will need to maintain full-time status (at least 12 units). Please note that if you are studying online you do not need to maintain full-time status. Additional charges apply to all students enrolled in more than 18 units.


Estimated Cost of Study


International students are required by the University to demonstrate that they are able to fund all tuition, fees, books, and living expenses throughout the duration of their studies. To do this, each student or sponsor (person funding the student’s education) must submit financial documentation in the form of an official letter or statement from a bank or financial institution. The document must show the availability of funds to cover the estimated total cost corresponding to the program of study.


Review the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
 over a 9-month period (fall and spring) or a 12-month period (fall, spring, and summer).


Graduate Assistantships


Assistantships are available for Metropolitan College graduate students through individual academic departments or programs. Contact information for individual academic departments may be found on the 
Graduate Assistantships page
.
