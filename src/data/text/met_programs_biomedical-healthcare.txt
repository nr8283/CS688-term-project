News & Events



The healthcare IT and health information communication fields are among the largest growth sectors in the modern economy. Massachusetts is home to hundreds of biotechnology companies, universities, and academic institutions that fuel innovation and research—and drive demand for qualified professionals. And the dynamic, highly regulated healthcare industry is rapidly growing, with new opportunities in healthcare IT, health insurance, public health, hospitals and medical practices, advertising, marketing, public relations, medical device companies, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, health journalism, education, and the non-profit sector, among others.


To prepare students for opportunities in these multidisciplinary areas, Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) offers a variety of graduate certificates and master’s degrees or degree concentrations designed to confer the skills needed to thrive and advance. In these areas, MET partners with other BU branches—such as the College of Communication for the MS in Health Communication—to ensure that students enjoy the full breadth of relevant academic resources available at BU, including career counseling and networking opportunities.


With BU MET’s Health Informatics Research Lab (HILab), you can tap into collaborative research and development in health informatics, bioinformatics, and clinical research. The College offers two master’s programs in Health Informatics that are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (
CAHIIM
). 
Completion of a CAHIIM-accredited master’s program entitles you
 to sit for professional certification exams offered through the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), such as the Certified Professional in Health Informatics (CPHI™) exam.


BU MET’s programs in healthcare-related fields are invaluable assets; whether you are in pursuit of a career change, a professional certification, or simply seek to add new skills to your toolkit.
