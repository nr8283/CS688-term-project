Qualify for Cybercrime Investigation Jobs with a Master’s in Criminal Justice


The 
Master of Science in Criminal Justice
 concentration in Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides practical and essential knowledge of cybercrime investigative techniques and cybersecurity practices.


While traditional crime has been on the decline since the 1990s, cybercrime has been on the rise. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), from its inception in 2000 through 2019, there have been 4,883,231 complaints received. In the years since 2015, IC3 reported an average of more than 340,000 complaints annually, with $10.2 billion in financial losses. That is just the tip of the iceberg, however, as some estimate that only 1 in 10 incidents are reported to law enforcement.

 Criminology and Crime Policy


Fall  ‘25
This course explores potential answers to complex and important questions about criminal behavior by drawing on the social science of criminology. Criminology is the interdisciplinary study of the development of law, criminal phenomena and societal responses to crime. The course has two primary focuses: 1) to explore and evaluate major explanations or theories of crime and 2) understand and evaluate the policy implications of major crime problems. Because criminology is interdisciplinary, students will examine theories that are grounded in a range of academic perspectives, including sociological, biological, political, psychological and economic explanations for crime. These theories will be centered on important public policy debates about a host of contemporary problems, including: firearm violence, high post- incarceration recidivism, opioid use disorder crisis and human trafficking. Course lectures and discussions focus on the historical development of the theories, their major assumptions and propositions, their relevance for public policy and practice. As the course progresses through each explanation for crime, students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate the validity of different explanations for crime as well as criminal justice policies and practices that they support.  [ 4 cr. ]

 White-Collar Crime


This course introduces students to the concept of white collar crime as an area of scientific inquiry and theory formation. It critically examines the latest scholarship on the subject by looking at white collar crime through a multiplicity of perspectives and reference points. These range from focus on the offense, offender, legal structure, organizational structure, individual, and organizational behavior, to victimization and guardianship, with special attention on the interaction between these components. The course also assesses the nature, extent, and consequences of white collar crime nationally and internationally. To enhance the understanding of white collar crime in today's Information Technology development, the course will pay special attention to roles of IT including fintech and cryptocurrency connections within white collar crime. It will also introduce rapidly emerging cybercrime issues while discussing various challenges of cybercrime investigation and limited digital forensics tools. Finally, the course examines current criminal justice system efforts at controlling white collar crime. Given the relative ineffectiveness of traditional criminal justice responses, alternative systems of control will be examined, ranging from compliance and regulations, private security, and public opinion, to prevention. Students will visit the websites of various government agencies or professional organizations to explore their functions and their current efforts to fight white collar crimes. Finally, many tangible research- based suggestions will be made regarding actions that organizations and businesses can take to reduce losses accrued due to white collar crime.  [ 4 cr. ]

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
