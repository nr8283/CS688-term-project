Learn to Analyze and Manage Risk


Available on campus and online, the Master of Science in Actuarial Science at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides you with the tools and knowledge to excel as an actuary. A solid foundation in calculus and multivariate calculus is recommended for applicants to this program. There are two optional concentrations:


Concentrations




Finance


Insurance




The world is filled with uncertainty and risk—and successful businesses need to quantify these risks. With their mathematical ability, analytic tools, and computer programming skills, actuaries are uniquely qualified to develop solutions to increasingly complex problems and to help quantify and manage risk for businesses in a variety of industries. By using data and models, actuaries have the expertise to determine the probability of certain future events. As an actuary, you develop ways to mitigate the impact of adverse financial circumstances on businesses, governmental agencies, and other organizations.

Prepare for a Rewarding Career as an Actuary


With a master’s degree in Actuarial Science from BU MET, you are well-positioned to work in a variety of traditional and non-traditional actuarial roles. Actuarial skills are valued in any field in which strong abilities in predictive risk analysis, mathematics, and statistics are essential to developing business strategies. Though actuaries work in a variety of areas, they are most notably integral in the insurance industry. Their analytic skills and ability to quantify risk and uncertainty make actuaries invaluable to insurance and financial teams, and essential to health insurance, life insurance, property and casualty insurance, and pension and health consulting firms. Actuaries are also employed by government agencies, accounting firms, banks, and financial services companies.


According to the 
Society of Actuaries
 (SoA) and the 
Casualty Actuarial Society
 (CAS), “Actuaries are the leading professionals in finding ways to manage risk. It takes a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge, and understanding of human behavior to manage today’s complex risks facing our society.” As industry practitioners, BU MET’s Actuarial Science faculty not only teach the basic information you need to succeed in an actuarial field, but give you the insight to “think like an actuary” when confronted with a real-world problem. Whether you decide to specialize in health insurance, life insurance, property and casualty insurance, pension and retirement benefits, enterprise risk management, or a less traditional actuarial role, your Actuarial Science master’s degree from Boston University will be valuable to you and to your employer.


Preparation for Professional Examinations


Courses in BU MET’s Actuarial Science master’s degree program are designed to not only help you have a deep understanding of the subject matter but also to assist you in preparing for examinations offered by the SoA and CAS. These examinations are essential in an actuary’s career. Students who follow the SoA exam track will typically work in fields such as life insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance, and pension plans, all of which use the probability of mortality. Those who follow the CAS exam track will typically work for companies that develop premiums for risks that are more quantifiable, such as automobile and homeowners insurance.




“The program provides a great opportunity to learn about the actuarial profession from real, working actuaries on top of the standard learning process for the degree and actuarial exams. Students should take full advantage of having experienced actuaries leading the courses and take any opportunities they can to learn and connect with them.”

 Economics and Management Decisions


Fall  ‘25
The aim of the course is to present decision problems and the economic analysis needed to guide these decisions. Microeconomic tools are used to structure complicated decision problems about production, pricing, investment, and other strategic issues and address uncertainty through probabilistic forecasts and sequential decisions. An important part of the course is to develop an understanding of the external environment in which firms operate by analyzing the implications of market structure, macroeconomic developments and policy, and other forms of public policy toward business.  [ 4 cr. ]
