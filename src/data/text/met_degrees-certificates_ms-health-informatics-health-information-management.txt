Develop Critical Skills in Health Information Management


Available online and on campus, the 
Master of Science in Health Informatics (MSHI)
 concentration in Health Information Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) builds upon the eight-course health informatics curriculum to focus on the management of health data, information, knowledge, and projects.


Over the last decade, massive introduction of electronic health records (EHRs) has revolutionized healthcare by enabling physicians and care providers to access comprehensive patient records and treatment history. The deployment of EHRs relies upon professionals who possess interdisciplinary knowledge of healthcare and information technology—and who are capable of bringing together an understanding of business, science, and IT skills in order to effectively manage and secure patient medical information.

Advance Your Career with a Master’s in Health Informatics


The health information management professional facilitates the smooth flow of digital information between patient and clinician, healthcare administrators, technologists, and others in the healthcare organization. As stewards of EHRs, health information managers are critical to the wellbeing of the patient. They must have expertise in data management systems, information security, and project management, as well as a comprehensive understanding of health informatics.


The primary focus of the Boston University Health Informatics master’s program is on electronic medical data generated and stored in healthcare and public health organizations. As a graduate of the MSHI program, you will have a solid knowledge of healthcare IT systems and EHRs, and command of the latest medical technologies. The opportunity to add a concentration in Health Information Management (HIM) prepares you to compete for critical roles in this fast-growing area.


Access to BU MET’s 
Health Informatics Research Lab (HILab)
 allows you to tap into collaborative research and development in medical informatics, bioinformatics, and clinical research.
