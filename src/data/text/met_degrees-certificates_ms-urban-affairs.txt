Learn to Solve Challenges in Planning, Urban Management, and Public Policy


The Master of Science in Urban Affairs (MSUA) is offered through BU MET’s Department of Applied Social Sciences, which oversees several graduate programs focusing on the challenges of the urban environment, including the 
Master of Science in City Planning (MSCP)
, the 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Sustainability
, the 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics
, and the 
Graduate Certificate in Urban Policy & Planning
.


BU’s Urban Affairs & City Planning programs prepare future leaders, practitioners, and innovators for the myriad challenges that arise in urban planning and policymaking. Students consider the political, social, and technical implications of each facet of planning and policymaking, and thus grapple with the fact that there are few, if any, simple solutions or approaches to urban issues.


The Master of Science in City Planning and Master of Science in Urban Affairs programs each provide a rigorous foundation for both new and experienced student-scholars and professionals.


Graduates can pursue a wide range of professional careers in town, city, and regional planning; sustainable management; community and economic development; transportation planning; public-sector/nonprofit management; and policy research, among others.


Graduate with Expertise


Boston University’s Urban Affairs master’s degree will equip you to:




Analyze key urban problems by understanding their historical context and interdependencies, focusing on identifying underlying causes and potential impacts.


Explain and assess the economic, political, social, and equity issues inherent in urban policy work.


Apply quantitative and qualitative research skills to theory-building, data-gathering and analysis, and urban policy-making processes.


Create relevant policy and planning solutions that incorporate the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders, including those of minority and disadvantaged communities.




Certificate-to-Degree Pathway


BU MET graduate certificate programs can serve as building blocks to a master’s degree. The 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Sustainability
, 
Graduate Certificate in Applied Urban Informatics
, and the

 Actionable Sustainability


Fall  ‘25
Sustainability generally refers to the ability of "systems" to be maintained such that they remain viable over long periods of time. As much as achieving the perfect sustainable equilibrium may be the ideal, it is important to recognize that there will be competing and conflicting interests, especially within complex hierarchical social, economic and ecological systems, particularly in light of ongoing climatic change. This field intensive course draws on the practices and theories of sustainability and climate change to understand what sustainability can mean in different contexts, and, more important, how nuanced, sustainable solutions can be achieved under varying conditions and in different systems. With an emphasis on the urban environment, the course will consist of projects in which students will identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real world issues. This course is intended for a wider audience from a range of disciplines.  [ 4 cr. ]

Master’s Thesis Option


A master’s thesis option is available for qualified students who have a GPA of 3.7 or higher. The 6-unit thesis option comprises MET UA 761 Thesis 1 and MET UA 762 Thesis 2, taken over two semesters. This option can be arranged through the City Planning & Urban Affairs program. Supervision by a full-time Boston University faculty member with a terminal degree is required. It is important to note that these two thesis courses are additional, making the total program requirement 38 units instead of the standard 32.


Course Waivers for Related Programs


Three core requirements for the Master Science in Urban Affairs and Master of Science in City Planning programs are identical. Therefore, Urban Affairs graduate students may opt to transfer their units to obtain a Master of Science in City Planning degree instead. In such cases, transferring MSCP candidates may receive a full waiver for all three core courses, provided they received a grade of B- or higher.


Master of Science in Urban Affairs students may pursue a certificate program in Commercial Real Estate or Real Estate Finance at Boston University’s 
Center for Professional Education (CPE)
. MSUA students who earn a CPE certificate in Commercial Real Estate or Real Estate Finance will be granted a waiver of one graduate-level elective course (4 units) toward their degree.

How Much Does This Program Cost?


BU MET Programs offer the flexibility of part-time or full-time study. Tuition, fees, and total program cost are determined by enrollment status. If you enroll in 1–2 courses (4–8 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
part-time per-unit rate
. If you enroll in 3–4 courses (12–16 units) in a semester, you are charged the 
full-time semester rate

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
