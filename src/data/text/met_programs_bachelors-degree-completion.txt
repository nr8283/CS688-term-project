Flexible, Part-Time Degree and Certificate Completion—at Boston University


Boston University’s Metropolitan College offers a wide range of bachelor’s degree completion programs in convenient, part-time evening formats—designed specifically for domestic* transfer students with at least six or more completed courses at a regionally accredited college or university. Our programs are ideal for busy professionals who seek to earn a Boston University degree without turning their personal lives upside down or putting their careers on hold.


Along with self-paced on-campus programs in a variety of majors, MET also offers the 
Online Undergraduate Degree Completion Program
.


Workplace Leverage


A bachelor’s degree can give you leverage within your current profession, provide depth to your workplace knowledge, and put you on an even playing field with your colleagues. According to 2024 US Bureau of Labor Statistics employment projections, a bachelor’s degree:




Boosts median annual salary by as much as 51 percent—compared to earnings of those with some college but no degree


Lays the foundation for advanced studies—pursue a professional master’s degree and the earnings projection grows to a 132 percent increase


Increases job security—the unemployment rate for bachelor’s holders is 2.5 percent, as opposed to 3.8 percent or higher for those without a degree.




Breadth of Knowledge


A report by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) has found that liberal arts degrees prepare people for successful careers—and that workers who majored in the humanities or social sciences earn more, especially when pairing their bachelor’s degree with a graduate or professional degree.


Getting your degree at Boston University can lead to more sophisticated job opportunities. A strong foundation in liberal arts ensures that you have the skills to think critically, communicate effectively, and appreciate subtle nuances. These strengths enhance your capabilities for growth and leadership within an organization, regardless of your major.


World-Class Degree, Network with Global Reach


Boston University boasts a worldwide network of more than 460,000 alumni—valuable connections available to you when you join BU. Steeped in research and industry experience, MET faculty and students come together from all professions, bringing practical lessons and real-world insight to your classroom.




*Please note that Metropolitan College does not issue visas to international students for full-time on-campus study in undergraduate programs (degree or non-degree).
