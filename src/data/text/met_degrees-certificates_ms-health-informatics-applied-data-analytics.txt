Hone Skills to Analyze and Visualize Healthcare Data


Available online and on campus, the 
Master of Science in Health Informatics (MSHI)
 concentration in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) builds upon the eight-course health informatics curriculum to focus on healthcare data processing, analysis, and visualization.


Over the last decade, massive introduction of electronic health records (EHRs) has revolutionized healthcare by enabling physicians and care providers to access comprehensive patient records and treatment history. The deployment of EHRs relies upon professionals who possess interdisciplinary knowledge of healthcare and information technology—and who can develop effective algorithms, analyze big data, and provide tools to help visualize that data for end-users.

MET AD 571
 Business Analytics Foundations


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: AD100 Pre-Analytics Laboratory
This course presents fundamental knowledge and skills for applying business analytics to managerial decision-making in corporate environments. Topics include descriptive analytics (techniques for categorizing, characterizing, consolidating, and classifying data for conversion into useful information for the purposes of understanding and analyzing business performance), predictive analytics (techniques for detection of hidden patterns in large quantities of data to segment and group data into coherent sets in order to predict behavior and trends), prescriptive analytics (techniques for identification of best alternatives for maximizing or minimizing business objectives). Students will learn how to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable analytics-based decisions. The framework of using interlinked data inputs, analytics models, and decision-support tools will be applied within a proprietary business analytics shell and demonstrated with examples from different functional areas of the enterprise. R, SQL, and Power BI software are used in this course.  [ 4 cr. ]

Formerly titled CS 544 Foundations of Analytics with R. 
The goal of this course is to provide students with the mathematical and practical background required in the field of data analytics. Probability and statistics concepts will be reviewed as well as the R tool for statistical computing and graphics. Different types of data are investigated along with data summarization techniques and plotting. Data populations using discrete, continuous, and multivariate distributions are explored. Errors during measurements and computations are analyzed in the course. Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing topics are also examined. The concepts covered in the course are demonstrated using R. Laboratory Course. Prereq: MET CS546 and (MET CS520 or MET CS521), or equivalent knowledge, or instructor's consent.  [ 4 cr. ]

MET AD 699
 Data Mining for Business Analytics


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisites: AD571
Enterprises, organizations, and individuals are creating, collecting, and using a massive amount of structured and unstructured data with the goal of converting the information into knowledge, improving the quality and the efficiency of their decision-making process, and better positioning themselves in the highly competitive marketplace. Data mining is the process of finding, extracting, visualizing, and reporting useful information and insights from both small and large datasets with the help of sophisticated data analysis methods. It is part of business analytics, which refers to the process of leveraging different forms of analytical techniques to achieve desired business outcomes through requiring business relevancy, actionable insight, performance management, and value management. The students in this course will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining. They will learn how to apply advanced models and software applications for data mining. Finally, students will learn how to examine the overall business process of an organization or a project with the goal of understanding (i) the business context where hidden internal and external value is to be identified and captured, and (ii) exactly what the selected data mining method does. Python, R, SQL, and Power BI software are used in this course.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Foundations of Machine Learning


Fall  ‘25
Formerly titled CS 555 Data Analysis and Visualization with R. 
This course provides an overview of the statistical tools most commonly used to process, analyze, and visualize data. Topics include simple linear regression, multiple regression, logistic regression, analysis of variance, and survival analysis. These topics are explored using the statistical package R, with a focus on understanding how to use and interpret output from this software as well as how to visualize results. In each topic area, the methodology, including underlying assumptions and the mechanics of how it all works along with appropriate interpretation of the results, are discussed. Concepts are presented in context of real world examples. Recommended Prerequisite: MET CS 544 or equivalent knowledge, or instructor's consent.  [ 4 cr. ]
