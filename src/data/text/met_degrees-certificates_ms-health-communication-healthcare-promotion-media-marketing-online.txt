Create Persuasive & Strategic Healthcare Messages


The 
Master of Science in Health Communication
 concentration in Healthcare Promotion, Media & Marketing will help you develop or refresh skills vital for today’s professional health communicator. Using influence and media effects theory, communication planning, and other fundamental behavioral and management concepts, you will learn to design integrated public relations, media, and marketing plans that help achieve the goals of health-related organizations and clients.


This is particularly vital as healthcare enters a transformative period. Healthcare industries are predicted to be among those growing the fastest through 2029 (
The Economics Daily
, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, September 2020). Additionally, by 2030 aging baby boomers will outnumber children for the first time, according to the Census Bureau. Meanwhile, an increase in chronic lifestyle diseases—diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, cancer, dementia, and other stress-related disorders—is helping drive expansion of the wellness industry, the value of which is poised to grow by $1,299.8 billion through 2024, according to a report by Technavio.


As we enter this fertile period for the healthcare industry, it is essential to be able to frame points of view and craft powerful messages using print, broadcast, social, community, and organizational media in creative ways to influence and educate diverse audiences. With a focus on workplace-ready skills, you will develop campaigns, search-optimized content, and materials—while understanding the importance of ethics, privacy, and regulatory considerations. You will also gain essential knowledge in brand, reputation, and crisis management.

“I use design skills and principles every single day at work. I recently completed a 60-page Health Equity Research Report using Adobe InDesign. The report is a combination of faculty interviews and summaries of publications and grants. Designing the layout of the report required me to apply lessons I learned during the program, such as color theory, accessible font selection, and the use of appropriate white space. The principles and skills from the program make me a better communicator, which, in turn, generates a greater audience reach for my creations.”

 US Healthcare System


This course provides students with basic knowledge of how the health care system in the U.S. is structured, and the policies, stakeholders and complexities impacting access to care, costs, quality and equity among various populations. Drawing on multiple views and opinions, students build on their perspectives as they critically analyze pros and cons of health system fundamentals. Students then apply their knowledge to a series of practical written assignments that help build a strategic plan for improving the health outcomes of an underserved population in their home state. An emphasis is placed on written and oral delivery of final project campaigns.

 Health Communication Principles and Strategies


Fall  ‘25
This foundational course examines and bridges the theory and practice of interpersonal, organizational, mass communication, and digital media relevant to the professional communicator and health practitioner alike. It reviews strategies of persuasion, the relationship between attitudes and health behavior through the lifespan, and the changing nature of health, illness and health delivery in local and global arenas. Students consider how the Social Determinants of Health (where we live, learn, work and play) impact health behaviors and outcomes for diverse populations. Starting with the history of health communication, students gain insight into the evolution of this emerging discipline, from public health education to its broader place in the marketing mix through recent decades. Guided by case studies, research and analysis, students explore the health communication cycle and strategic planning process using frames, channels and tools best suited for reaching behavioral, social, and organizational objectives. The course shifts from theoretical to practical, giving students hands-on experience developing a strategic health communication campaign that considers culture, age, gender and health literacy, to effectively -- and measurably -- influence health outcomes for its intended audience.

If writing does not come naturally to you, this course will introduce you to those health literacy principles, as well as formats and processes for developing materials with confidence. If you're a more experienced writer, get ready to hone your skills using best practices for creating various kinds of health content. Throughout the course you'll analyze different audience needs and refine writing strategies, style, voice, and vocabulary to accommodate each audience. You'll also practice essential writing qualities, including clarity and brevity, alongside advanced grammar, sentence structure and writing mechanics. Assignments include writing, revising, and editing clear, accurate, audience-appropriate content for a journalistic news report; a patient education print brochure; narrative feature storytelling; a health-related blog; scriptwriting for a visual public service announcement, and social media writing to promote your content
