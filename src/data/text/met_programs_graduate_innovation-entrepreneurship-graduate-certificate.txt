Learn the Concepts of Innovation-Driven Markets and Entrepreneurism


Available online and on campus, the Graduate Certificate in Innovation & Entrepreneurship at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) focuses on providing you with the key managerial competencies required to facilitate the development of commercialized innovations, which often demands the engagement of a diverse set of actors working to resolve critical technical problems and uncertainties. Our hands-on approach enables you to develop entrepreneurial skills in identifying mission-oriented business challenges.


History has shown that crisis inspires innovation—which is critical to keeping many people’s lives and workplaces functioning safely. While the economic impact of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or regional conflicts can bring swift and intense disruptions to supply chains, demand patterns, and distribution channels, these challenges also create new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, which at their essence, attempt to identify an unmet need and move as fast as possible to get a meaningful product to market.


By providing an understanding of the ways innovation can address long-term problems—and entrepreneurism can bring solutions to fruition—the Innovation & Entrepreneurship certificate at BU MET will help you develop the necessary skills to innovate and accelerate collaboration in a productive manner. Through the process of innovation, you will be able to bring together the knowledge and expertise necessary to develop new products and solutions to a pre-commercial stage relevant to rapidly changing technological, economic, and cultural environments—ranging from start-ups to large multinational companies, and from high-tech and biotech companies to more traditional environments such as retail, healthcare, and financial services. The Innovation & Entrepreneurship certificate program will also help you explore concepts related to the commercialization of technology, the changing basis of competitive advantage over time, and the modern approaches to adding value to products and services—including user interfaces, user experience, and consumer branding. You will develop the ability to apply research-based concepts related to innovation and to manage the commercial development and improvement of products and services.
