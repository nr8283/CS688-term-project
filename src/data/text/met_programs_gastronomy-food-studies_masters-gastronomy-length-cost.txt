How Long Does a Master’s in Gastronomy Take to Complete—and What is the Cost?
















Back to Programs
Gastronomy & Food Studies


Pursuing an education as an adult presents distinct challenges. How do you earn a graduate degree while tending to the demands of your profession, your family, and your limited free time? How do you afford it—and how big a bite will it take out of your time? At Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET), there are options that enable you to balance an education with the demands of life.


Master’s degree programs at BU’s Metropolitan College have been carefully designed to provide flexible modes of study within the parameters of a rigorous education. That means you have more control over how long you choose to take to complete a program, and whether to pursue it as a full-time or part-time student—a calculation that plays a role in how much a degree at BU MET might cost.


Take BU MET’s 
Master of Arts in Gastronomy
. The MA in Gastronomy at BU is a meal ticket for those interested in the study of food and the role it plays in culture and society, providing entry to a world of fellow epicures, dining professionals, food historians, vendors and entrepreneurs, and culinary academics. While the benefits of studying food studies at BU MET commence as soon as you begin your first course, practical questions remain, determining the path to graduation and the next stage of your career.


BU MET has a long history—over half a century—supporting nontraditional learners from diverse walks of life in pursuit of their education. The college offers a variety of ways you can tailor your program to suit the needs and demands of your own life. Practically speaking, you can choose to enroll in courses offered during the fall, spring, and summer terms. Whether you pursue your course of study full-time or part-time is your choice, based on what works best for you. Additionally, you can pursue the MA entirely online, which is also true for Metropolitan College’s 
Graduate Certificate in Food Studies
 program—and BU MET allows you to transfer those four courses into the Gastronomy master’s.


How Many Years Will It Take to Earn a Gastronomy Master’s at BU?


The short answer is that it depends. Will you study part-time or full-time? Will you take courses every semester—spring, summer, and fall—or will you take a break from your studies between terms? Will you study evenings on campus or online? At BU’s Metropolitan College, these are all decisions you can make based on what works best for you.


For those studying on campus, the 40-unit MA in Gastronomy at Boston University can be completed in 12 months of full-time study, and as few as 24 months as a part-time student.


For those pursuing the master’s in Gastronomy online, you can complete the program part-time in five semesters, or 24 months.

A BU Education is Within Reach


Metropolitan College was established at Boston University in 1965 in order to ensure that adult learners had access to a prestigious Boston University education through flexible learning options and affordable tuition. Many students at BU MET are working professionals; as such, they earn their degree or certificate while working part-time or full-time. That reality often dictates how much time a student can commit to graduate study each term. For those studying part-time, BU MET offers competitive tuition that brings a BU education within reach.


At the same time, Metropolitan College offers opportunities for full-time study for those who wish to commit as much time as possible to their courses each semester. Full-time options are also excellent for 
international students
 who must maintain F-1 visa status in order to study in the US.

What is the ultimate cost and duration of the program? You’ll have to decide that for yourself, depending on the specific way you manage and complete your requirements. But no matter how you achieve your degree, you’ll find, like those before you, the main course to be worth the preparation.
