Boost Your Communication Career with Skills in Healthcare Promotion


Boston University’s online Graduate Certificate in Healthcare Promotion, Media & Marketing allows students to develop or refresh skills vital for today’s professional health communicator. Using persuasion theory, media effects theory, communication planning, and other fundamental behavioral and management concepts, students learn to design integrated public relations, media, and marketing plans that help achieve the goals of health-related organizations and clients.


In today’s climate of greater integration among public relations, media, and marketing disciplines, even recently educated communication professionals are challenged by the pace of change in their professions and across the media landscape. Moreover, the needs of the healthcare industry are rapidly evolving. An increase in chronic lifestyle diseases—diabetes, blood pressure, asthma, arthritis, cancer, dementia, and other stress-related disorders—is helping drive expansion of the wellness industry, the value of which is poised to grow by $1,299.8 billion through 2024, according to a report by Technavio. Alongside this, United States Census Bureau data shows that one in five Americans will be 65 or older by 2034, with aging baby boomers outnumbering children for the first time in 2030. Professional health communicators are key stewards of a changing industry, who are able to frame points of view and create powerful messages using print, broadcast, social, community, and organizational media in creative ways to influence and educate diverse audiences.


The Graduate Certificate in Healthcare Promotion, Media & Marketing focuses on building workplace-ready skills for professional communication roles within consumer- and business-facing corporations, government agencies, healthcare organizations and hospitals, PR and marketing agencies, non-profit organizations, and other employers seeking to advocate for, educate, and influence audiences about health and wellness. You will learn the differences, similarities, and tensions among promotion, media, and marketing functions within organizations, and how to effectively implement and align contemporary strategies and measurable tactics as part of a unified effort. And you will become adept in developing campaigns, search-optimized content, and materials for the healthcare marketing environment—while gaining an understanding of the importance of ethics, privacy, and regulatory considerations. You also gain essential knowledge in brand, reputation, and crisis management.

“When I began the program, I was the director of marketing for an independent hospital and I was able to use concepts I was learning right from the get-go. From creating more effective project briefs and SWOT analyses to directing a photo or video shoot and using storyboards and shot lists, I was becoming a much more effective marketing director on both the management and creative side of the job.”
