Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
