Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Medical Studies














Back to Programs
Curriculum
Apply Now
Request Information


Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET), in conjunction with 
BU’s College of Arts & Sciences
, offers the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Medical Studies. This certificate program permits those with bachelor’s degrees from regionally accredited US colleges and universities to pursue the course requirements for application to medical school and other health career programs. 


As the certificate is intended for career changes, eligible applicants will have previously taken either very few or no prior science courses. The program is meant for students with strong academic backgrounds; a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.3 is required for admission. Students who have already completed more than three of the prerequisite courses are not eligible for the program at Boston University.

A Foundation for Success in Medicine


Students who complete the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Pre-Medical Studies will be able to demonstrate:




Preparedness for admission to medical school and other health career programs, having completed the course requirements typically needed for entrance to these programs.


Satisfactory undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, general and organic chemistry, and biology.




Certificate students are eligible for advising assistance from the 
Pre-Professional Advising Office
 in the College of Arts & Sciences.


Frequently Asked Questions


HOW LONG IS THE PRE-MEDICAL STUDIES PROGRAM?


To receive the certificate, students must take a minimum of eight courses. The Pre-Medical Studies program is flexible, allowing you to target the courses that you need to take, in the time frame that you want to take them.


Students are cautioned against the practice of accelerating the completion of the pre-medical requirements to finish in the shortest possible time. This may be counter-productive, since taking a highly compressed science program may result in poor grades. It is more advisable to start taking one or two science courses, with the possibility of accelerating during the ensuing semesters.


WHO ARE THE STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE IN CLASS WITH ME?


You have the option of taking the courses during the day or evening. If you attend during the day, the courses are offered through the College of Arts & Sciences (CAS). CAS courses consist of traditional Boston University undergraduate students. Evening courses are offered through Metropolitan College (MET), which is the continuing education division of Boston University. MET students range from full-time, traditional students to working professionals who are completing their degree. MET also enrolls individuals who are taking courses for personal or professional development, and who are not matriculated into a degree program.


WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO ME?


Students in the program receive advising and guidance from the Pre-Professional Advising Office, which is located in the College of Arts & Sciences. You will be advised by pre-medical counselors who can assist you with course selection and the medical school application process. Students are strongly encouraged to make an appointment to meet with Michelle Sherman, director of pre-health advising, prior to course registration. Additional services are provided to you through Boston University.


WHAT IF I NEED FEWER THAN THE EIGHT REQUIRED COURSES FOR THE CERTIFICATE—CAN I STILL APPLY?


You may still apply, and a pre-medical advisor will make suggestions as to what higher-level courses might enhance your academic record. You must complete eight courses in the program.


WHAT IS THE COST OF THE PROGRAM?


The cost for the fall and spring semesters depends on:




How many classes you are taking


Whether your classes are taken in the day or evening




Please refer to the Registration and Tuition Policies below for a course by course tuition breakdown. Please note: Summer Term tuition-per-unit varies each academic year.


The above costs do not include lab fees or registration fees.


IS THERE FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE?


Certificate programs are not eligible for federal financial aid.


CAN I TAKE BU COURSES WITHOUT BEING IN THIS CERTIFICATE PROGRAM?


MET has an open-enrollment policy, which means that you can register for classes without being in a certificate program or matriculating into a degree program. However, you cannot take courses during the day unless you are a degree student or enrolled in the Pre-Medical Studies certificate program. If you are not a certificate student, you do not have access to the advising services offered through the Pre-Professional Advising Office.


WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM?




You have the option of taking courses during the day as well as in the evening.


You can take courses at your own pace.


You will have access to the Pre-Professional Advising Office. Pre-health advisors counsel students about all matters pertaining to their professional goals, including course selection, professional school admissions requirements, volunteer opportunities, internships, and the application process.
