MET AD 515
 Project Management


Fall  ‘25
The course explores modern project management by providing an enterprise- level, experiential view of the discipline focused on connecting projects to the organization's mission, vision, and values. The theme of the course is applying key project management tools and techniques, through case-based group work, which will help students identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real-world issues. Groups select, plan, report, and then present on their project's scope, schedule, cost, risk, quality, and communications elements using tools such as the WBS, network diagram, PERT estimate, Gantt chart (including the use of MS Project), risk register, and heat map. Students also gain familiarity with important new concepts in project management: Agile frameworks, actionable sustainability thinking, and Benefits Realization Management, all of which will be important for their success not only in other graduate courses, but as they lead projects for their organizations so as to provide lasting, triple-bottom-line value. The course is aligned with the latest PMBOK' Guide from the Project Management Institute.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Project Leadership and Emerging Communication Technologies


Fall  ‘25
This course examines the increasing importance of leadership and communications in projects. Since project outcomes and the delivery of value are accomplished through teams of people, the course aims to improve the capability of a project manager to become a project leader and to excel at motivating and inspiring their teams. Students begin by gaining a better understanding of their own social, leadership, and communications styles. Self-awareness is key to the course. We investigate motivation, conflict management, negotiation skills, and the Agile principles of stewardship and servant leadership. Grounded in the use of tools, the course will provide students with templates to enhance team collaboration and communication. The course also addresses more contemporary issues in PM, including resolving ambiguity and complexity, the use of improvised working styles, sustainable PM, and issues around power and politics within the project.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Project Risk and Cost Management


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: PM 100. In this course, you will be introduced to macro and micro approaches to project cost estimation.

You will learn how to manage both project cost and schedule objectives using the Earned Value and Earned Schedule Measurement Systems. You will also study risk management through an examination of both individual and overall project risk and apply your learnings using advanced risk management software in an actual case study. Project quality management, procurement/contract management, and project ethics and professional conduct will be explored using case study scenarios.  [ 4 cr. ]
