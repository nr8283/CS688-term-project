Develop Effective Health Communication Skills


To prepare students for 21st-century roles in healthcare marketing, public and media relations, digital and integrated health communication, education, promotion, and advocacy, Boston University’s Metropolitan College and College of Communication offer the Master of Science in Health Communication (MSHC)—with two optional concentrations:


Concentrations




Healthcare Promotion, Media & Marketing


Visual & Digital Health Communication




Healthcare issues affect people worldwide and can range from health system reform to environmental crises, to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. United States Census Bureau data shows that one in five Americans will be 65 or older by 2034, while a report by Technavio shows that the value of the global health and wellness market is poised to grow by $1,299.8 billion through 2024. The impact of digital technology in healthcare will continue to reverberate, with venture funding for health tech innovators at $14 billion in 2020 and expected to increase, according to Deloitte. In fact, healthcare industries will be among those growing the fastest through 2029, according to 
The Economics Daily
 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, September 2020). Whether driven by growth or disruption, healthcare organizations and the many affiliated health and wellness businesses will all need professional health communicators.


BU’s Health Communication master’s provides the essential skills, strategic insights, and up-to-the-minute industry knowledge required to navigate and interpret evolving information about healthcare, enabling you to provide informed messaging that cuts through the conflicting data, misinformation, and jargon that confuse the public. In order to prepare you to execute an effective and responsible communication strategy, BU’s program will help you develop a holistic understanding of biosystems and disease, the social and cultural determinants of public health, the American healthcare system, and epidemiology—ensuring that you have the critical ability to communicate information in a way both the media and the public can understand.

 US Healthcare System


This course provides students with basic knowledge of how the health care system in the U.S. is structured, and the policies, stakeholders and complexities impacting access to care, costs, quality and equity among various populations. Drawing on multiple views and opinions, students build on their perspectives as they critically analyze pros and cons of health system fundamentals. Students then apply their knowledge to a series of practical written assignments that help build a strategic plan for improving the health outcomes of an underserved population in their home state. An emphasis is placed on written and oral delivery of final project campaigns.

 Health Communication Principles and Strategies


Fall  ‘25
This foundational course examines and bridges the theory and practice of interpersonal, organizational, mass communication, and digital media relevant to the professional communicator and health practitioner alike. It reviews strategies of persuasion, the relationship between attitudes and health behavior through the lifespan, and the changing nature of health, illness and health delivery in local and global arenas. Students consider how the Social Determinants of Health (where we live, learn, work and play) impact health behaviors and outcomes for diverse populations. Starting with the history of health communication, students gain insight into the evolution of this emerging discipline, from public health education to its broader place in the marketing mix through recent decades. Guided by case studies, research and analysis, students explore the health communication cycle and strategic planning process using frames, channels and tools best suited for reaching behavioral, social, and organizational objectives. The course shifts from theoretical to practical, giving students hands-on experience developing a strategic health communication campaign that considers culture, age, gender and health literacy, to effectively -- and measurably -- influence health outcomes for its intended audience.

If you're a more experienced writer, get ready to hone your skills using best practices for creating various kinds of health content. Throughout the course you'll analyze different audience needs and refine writing strategies, style, voice, and vocabulary to accommodate each audience. You'll also practice essential writing qualities, including clarity and brevity, alongside advanced grammar, sentence structure and writing mechanics. Assignments include writing, revising, and editing clear, accurate, audience-appropriate content for a journalistic news report; a patient education print brochure; narrative feature storytelling; a health-related blog; scriptwriting for a visual public service announcement, and social media writing to promote your content

MET HC 762
 Visual Communication in the Digital Health Age


Over the past two decades, the power of visuals in learning and retention has been increasingly recognized -- attributing as much as 80  of retention to information that is visually communicated. In a recent study, 85  of working professionals agreed that creative thinking is critical for problem solving in their career, and 71  say creative thinking should be taught as a course, like math and science. The efficacy of the use of visual symbols has also been recognized for bridging language barriers in health care settings. This course provides health communication professionals the fundamental principles of design and how these relate to effective communication, particularly in health education and delivery applications. Course lectures and resources will guide students from visual design theory, straight through content creation and measuring effectiveness of visual messaging. Students will explore various media and tools used to create digital images and get hands-on practice in the image editing process. Topics include conceptual design, critical thinking in the creation of practical design, how design relates to industry, human perception and the visual process, and the use of symbols for immediacy and to bridge cultural and literacy divides. In addition to exploring popular digital vehicles for visual storytelling, such as infographics, data visualization, video and mobile, the course will also present real- world challenges, such as ethics and regulations in digital communications, as well as business processes. Course requires access to a smartphone with camera and video capability or a digital camera/video.

This course helps students understand the power and importance of this fundamental shift in communication, and how savvy health care organizations are turning this shift into a strategic advantage. Together, we will examine the impact of the communication technology revolution on the field of health marketing and communication. Through extensive readings, case studies, project assignments, hands-on use of social media and weekly discussions, students will explore the extraordinary health communication challenges and opportunities driven by social media -- as well as the new and daunting problems and threats social media present to healthcare organizations. Students will learn how social media is used in health care and why using it effectively and efficiently has become a necessary skill for many health care professionals. As part of this course, students have the opportunity to earn the Mayo-Hootsuite Social Media Basics Certification, and participate in the Mayo Clinic Social Media Network community. 
Please note: This 4-credit course meets over a 7-week period. Students should expect about twice the weekly workload of a 14-week course.  [ 4 cr. ]
