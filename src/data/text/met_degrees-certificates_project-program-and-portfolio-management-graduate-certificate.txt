Boost Your Project Management Career With Portfolio Management Skills


The Graduate Certificate in Project, Program & Portfolio Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides students with a set of courses that develops their ability in the areas of program and portfolio management. The certificate provides guidance on the principles, practices, and activities of program management that support good program and portfolio management practices across all industry domains.


The 2020 Project Management Institute Pulse of the Profession® notes that “Organizations are undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift in which projects are no longer adjacent to operations but instead primary to how work gets done and problems get solved. In today’s C-suite—and tomorrow’s—it is the portfolio that disrupts, that innovates, that expands and thrives.” More people will be hired to manage project portfolios as industries become more project-oriented. In fact, it is predicted that the global economy will need 25 million new project professionals by 2030 (PMI 2021 Talent Gap Report).

“While working in various project management roles, I realized the immense value that formal training and a structured curriculum could bring to my skill set. Despite my professional experience, I recognized the need to deepen my theoretical understanding and stay ahead of industry trends. This realization, coupled with a desire for professional growth and career advancement, motivated me to pursue a master’s degree in project management.”
