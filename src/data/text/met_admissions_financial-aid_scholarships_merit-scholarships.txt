Merit Scholarships


The unique educational experience at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) is defined not only by dedicated, expert faculty, but by students who are self-motivated, professionally accomplished, and driven to succeed. MET students make exceptional contributions to the classroom, sharing diverse perspectives on complex issues and serving as a valuable resource for peer support and network connections.


MET offers merit scholarships of up to $5,000 toward tuition and fees to eligible students admitted to a graduate degree program, based on the strength of each applicant’s academic qualifications and professional experience. Award recipients are notified within their admission letter, with awards disbursed in even installments for each course of enrollment toward master’s degree requirements. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA and good academic standing to maintain their merit scholarship award.
