Advance Your Career in Risk Management


According to research by Gartner, companies that had clear risk management protocols in place were much more effective in implementing an agile response to the fast-emerging risks of coronavirus. New insider threats to the enterprise are now becoming evident as organizations explore new ways to function. The future is full of unknowns, and by all accounts risk and business continuity professionals will be in high demand. Offered on campus and online, BU MET’s MS in Enterprise Risk Management provides the tools and concepts necessary to plan for, prevent, and—when needed—successfully respond to disruptions in business operations.


The imperative of the 21
st
-century business environment, enterprise risk management is a holistic management construct for identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in an organization and its business enterprise. The practice concerns ongoing, never-ending strategies to evaluate and mitigate potential disruptions, and encompasses resiliency planning, prevention, crisis management, business continuity management, and technology recovery. As such, the ability to contribute to enterprise risk planning and execution is an important skill for business leaders in roles that include business process consultant, compliance officer, disaster recovery manager, vice president of business continuity, and more. Our graduates have gone on to roles in Disney, Johnsonville LLC, and Deutsche Bank, to name a few.

 Enterprise Risk Planning and Compliance


Prereq: MET AD610 - Students are exposed to the important issues relating to corporate and organizational security and risk from both the perspective of systems designed to protect against disasters and aspects of emergency preparedness should systems fail. Engineering science is applied to security areas that include information technology, terrorism, and other organization disruptions. Students study proactive risk assessment through analytical risk analysis techniques and simulations. Students will be able to design a company or agency global assurance plan, organize the strategy to make the plan operational, and implement control measures to assess the plan's degree of success. The course also provides explanations of legal/regulatory, auditing, and industry- specific requirements related to compliance, control, and reporting issue sin business risk management. The role of establishing and maintaining standards by local, national, and international agencies is discussed, as is the importance of these agencies in certifying operations.  [ 4 cr. ]




MET AD 614
 Disaster Management


Prerequisite: MET AD617 -This course takes concepts covered in MET AD617 and applies them in more detail mainly to the corporate-private sector environment. During this course, we will first review the organization and processes necessary to effectively respond to and manage incidents, including the transition from emergency response and incident management to business recovery. The course will focus on disaster recovery, an absolutely essential but sometimes overlooked component of any successful corporate recovery program. Here, the emphasis is on technology recovery. This includes reviewing the key components of the IT infrastructure; how these components are accounted for in the response and recovery processes; and some best practices in technology recovery modelling. Several emerging technologies relative to cloud computing, information security, etc., are also examined. Prereq: MET AD617  [ 4 cr. ]




MET AD 618
 Technology Risk Management

Prerequisite: MET AD 610 - Discover how leading organizations manage a wide array of technology-related threats and vulnerabilities, ranging from routine outages and operational errors to infrastructure breakdowns and systems failures - right up to significant data breaches, denial of service and ransomware attacks. You will review principles of technology resilience and its role within the organizational enterprise risk management structure. From there, the greater technology risk landscape is evaluated, the importance of governance and compliance are reinforced, and the infrastructure and processes necessary for organizations to effectively manage technology-related incidents are examined. The course also includes an examination of how enterprises transition from incident management to technology recovery, and how leading companies design and implement cybersecurity and privacy programs.  [ 4 cr. ]
