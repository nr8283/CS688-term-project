Prepare for the Future of City Planning


Integrating the necessary skills, knowledge, values, and ethics to train future evidence-informed city planners, the Master of Science in City Planning (MSCP) at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) prepares you for a wide variety of professional roles in urban planning, emphasizing the development and implementation of strategies to create sustainable and equitable urban environments.


The professional planner frequently functions as a member of a multidisciplinary team and is involved in various stages of the city planning process, including research, analysis, designing planning alternatives, engaging with communities, and implementing projects aimed at improving urban and regional environments. Additionally, planners are often tasked with forecasting future trends, monitoring ongoing developments, and formulating public investment strategies to ensure sustainable growth and equitable resource allocation.


BU MET’s MS in City Planning develops the skills needed to navigate technical, socio-political, and economic considerations that go into making an equitable, resilient, and sustainable city while facing the implications of climate change and public health crises.

As much as achieving the perfect sustainable equilibrium may be the ideal, it is important to recognize that there will be competing and conflicting interests, especially within complex hierarchical social, economic and ecological systems, particularly in light of ongoing climatic change. This field intensive course draws on the practices and theories of sustainability and climate change to understand what sustainability can mean in different contexts, and, more important, how nuanced, sustainable solutions can be achieved under varying conditions and in different systems. With an emphasis on the urban environment, the course will consist of projects in which students will identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real world issues. This course is intended for a wider audience from a range of disciplines.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Planning and the Development Process


Fall  ‘25
This course specifically explores the area where the private and public sectors meet so that the student can develop an awareness of the complexity of dealing with these often competing interests. The objective of the course is to give the student an understanding of the motivations of the private sector in the way they go about creating their products and projects and to leave the student with the tools and knowledge to successfully negotiate the Public Interest with the Private Needs.   [ 4 cr. ]
