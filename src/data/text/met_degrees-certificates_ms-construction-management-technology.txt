Learn to Lead Projects in the Built Environment


Designed to prepare professionals for senior leadership roles in the built environment and infrastructure industries, the Master of Science in Construction Management & Technology (MSCMT) at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) integrates cutting-edge technologies, sustainable practices, and advanced project management methodologies to equip you with the technical, managerial, and leadership skills necessary to excel in today’s evolving construction sector.


According to 
McKinsey Global Institute
, to keep up with GDP growth the world will need to invest an average of $3.7 trillion in global economic infrastructure—annually— through 2035. Meanwhile, the US 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
 allocated more than $550 billion in new spending through 2026, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that jobs in 
construction management
 will see much-faster-than-average growth of 9 percent through 2033, with annual median pay exceeding $100,000. Additional construction needs will arise from rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters and conflicts.


BU MET’s Construction Management & Technology master’s degree focuses on the technical management aspects of implementing construction projects—varying in size from medium to large-scale megaprojects within various contexts. By emphasizing sustainability and digitalization in construction while developing the appropriate leadership and communications capabilities, as well as expertise in safety standards using modern technological tools, the MS in Construction Management & Technology prepares you for the future of the industry.
