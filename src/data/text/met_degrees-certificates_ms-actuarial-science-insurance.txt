Prepare for a Rewarding Career as an Actuary


With a master’s degree in Actuarial Science from BU MET, you are well-positioned to work in a variety of traditional and non-traditional actuarial roles. Actuarial skills are valued in any field in which strong abilities in predictive risk analysis, mathematics, and statistics are essential to developing business strategies. Though actuaries work in a variety of areas, they are most notably integral in the insurance industry. Their analytic skills and ability to quantify risk and uncertainty make actuaries invaluable to insurance and financial teams, and essential to health insurance, life insurance, property and casualty insurance, and pension and health consulting firms. Actuaries are also employed by government agencies, accounting firms, banks, and financial services companies.


According to the 
Society of Actuaries
 (SoA) and the 
Casualty Actuarial Society
 (CAS), “Actuaries are the leading professionals in finding ways to manage risk. It takes a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge, and understanding of human behavior to manage today’s complex risks facing our society.” As industry practitioners, BU MET’s Actuarial Science faculty not only teach the basic information you need to succeed in an actuarial field but give you the insight to “think like an actuary” when confronted with a real-world problem. Whether you decide to specialize in health insurance, life insurance, property and casualty insurance, pension and retirement benefits, enterprise risk management, or a less traditional actuarial role, your Actuarial Science master’s degree from Boston University will be valuable to you and to your employer.


Preparation for Professional Examinations


Courses in BU MET’s Actuarial Science master’s degree program are designed to not only help you have a deep understanding of the subject matter, but also to assist you in preparing for examinations offered by the SoA and CAS. These examinations are essential in an actuary’s career. Students who follow the SoA exam track will typically work in fields such as life insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance, and pension plans, all of which use the probability of mortality. Those who follow the CAS exam track will typically work for companies that develop premiums for risks that are more quantifiable, such as automobile and homeowners insurance.
