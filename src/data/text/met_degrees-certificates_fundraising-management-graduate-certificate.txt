*Based on 2025–2026 Boston University tuition and fees.

Available on campus and online, the Graduate Certificate in Fundraising Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides administrative, financial, technical, and leadership skills for those seeking careers as professional fundraisers and for nonprofit managers who wish to substantially enhance their success in fundraising.


More than ever, fundraising remains a strategic institutional need. While nonprofit organizations have always faced financial hardships, the next decade poses different challenges for fundraisers. In addition to shifting demographics, technologies, and political landscapes—not to mention changes in government and foundation support and increased competition for funds—nonprofit organizations are now trying to surmount fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


The good news is that funders are keen to support nonprofits and are positioning themselves to help, and those seeking to guide their organization to safety can benefit from BU MET’s four-course Fundraising Management curriculum. The certificate is appropriate for professionals working in the arts, healthcare, education, and human services fields. As a 
CFRE Approved Provider Program
 for Continuing Education, BU MET’s Fundraising Management certificate program curriculum provides effective preparation for the optional Certified Fund Raising Executive (CFRE) certification exam.


Designed and delivered by the expert faculty of BU MET’s Arts Administration program, the Graduate Certificate in Fundraising Management serves the many practicing and aspiring nonprofit professionals who do not have the time or resources to commit to a full program of graduate study, or may already possess a graduate degree in another field. This certificate may be of particular interest to experienced professionals in related fields who are considering a career change.


Certificate students have access to all the resources of the department and the University, including internship and job placement services.




“Before I started at MET, I worked primarily in patron services and box office but knew I wanted to shift into development. Making that transition can be challenging, but I started taking courses within the Fundraising Management Graduate Certificate program almost immediately upon getting to BU. Because of what I learned in these courses, I got my first role on the Jacob’s Pillow philanthropy team and was promoted to my current position upon completing the program. The start of my entire career in fundraising is thanks to MET.”
