Learn to Secure & Safeguard Medical Data


Available on campus, online, and in a blended format, the Graduate Certificate in Medical Information Security & Privacy at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides valuable exposure to the complex and varied factors that must be taken into account when addressing information security issues within healthcare systems.


From malware threats and email fraud to ransomware and cryptomining, healthcare-related cyberattacks are on the rise. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, there have been over 3,000 healthcare data breaches reported since 2009. Attacks in 2019 increased 38 percent from 2018, with hacking, theft, and unauthorized access/disclosure topping the list of issues. Radware’s 2018–2019 Global Application and Network Security Report shows that the cost of recovering from a cyberattack, for the average healthcare organization, is $1.4 million.


Emphasizing healthcare data privacy and security, BU MET’s Medical Information Security & Privacy graduate certificate program presents the methods and skills needed for designing and building secure and reliable systems by developing an understanding of the special requirements of healthcare systems, where privacy of personal data must be balanced with access to patient records.








#10, Best Online Master's in Computer Information Technology Programs


MET’s online master’s degrees in computer information technology are ranked #10 in the nation by 
U.S. News & World Report
 for 2025.
