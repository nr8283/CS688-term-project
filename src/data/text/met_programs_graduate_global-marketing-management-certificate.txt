Neuromarketing is transforming the global marketing industry as a relatively new discipline, quickly transforming how marketers influence consumers and their buying decisions. The rapid increase in the uptake of neuromarketing across multiple business domains and applications across industries is making it imperative that global marketers take heed and start applying them to their marketing strategies as well. This course leverages three core disciplines: marketing, market research, and brain science. In this course, students will learn how neuromarketing is gaining moment in the industry because it leverages how the consumer's brain reacts and responds to specific marketing incentives and stimuli. It ensures that the marketing efforts and their effectiveness are well- measured and accurate through applied neuromarketing analytics in a lab environment. This course also leverages neuromarketing research during lab sessions, using various cutting-edge and innovative techniques through biometric and brain signals to examine consumer behavior and develop relevant marketing strategies.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Doing Business in North America


Students are introduced to the latest requirements, techniques, procedures, and practices for successfully 'Doing Business in North America'. Emphasis is placed on managing in the most competitive business environment in the world; preparing, implementing, and maintaining sustainable international business transactions and operations. We begin with a description of driving forces and starting conditions for being a competitive and sustainable business enterprise including the role of the market integration in the NAFTA region. Included is consideration of corporate market entry strategies such as import and export agreements and transactions, contractual agreements, strategic alliances, and direct foreign investments. Factors of risk management, business continuity management, and performance management (on project and corporate levels) are considered. Regional policies, international trade development, opportunities in international trade development, and forward- looking challenges are examined. All participants attend live online lectures, partake in discussion boards and complete a group term project involving business simulation. The project is developed in stages (decision rounds) throughout the term and teams compete during each stage.   [ 4 cr. ]
