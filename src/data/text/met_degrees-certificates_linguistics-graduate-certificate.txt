Prepare for Further Study in Modern Linguistics


The Graduate Certificate in Linguistics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) is designed for students with a bachelor’s degree who are interested in pursuing a graduate degree in linguistics, but who do not have the necessary background. This is likely to be the case for those who developed an interest in linguistics late in their undergraduate studies or after they received their bachelor’s degree. The Linguistics graduate certificate may also be of interest to professionals in fields with some connection to linguistics who would like to get additional training and credentials.


Students are expected to have already taken an introductory undergraduate course in linguistics or to have acquired equivalent knowledge prior to applying to the certificate program. Students who lack this background will be required to take Introduction to Linguistics (MET LX 250) or acquire equivalent knowledge before registering for the graduate certificate program. Students interested in this certificate but who lack that background are encouraged to consult with the director of graduate admissions for linguistics.

Gain a Solid Foundation in Linguistics


BU MET’s Linguistics graduate certificate curriculum is designed to prepare students to apply to an 
MA
 or 
PhD
 program offered through Boston University’s 
Department of Linguistics
 or elsewhere. Completion of the certificate is not a guarantee of admission to the Boston University graduate programs in linguistics. However, should a student enter the 
BU Linguistics master’s program
 upon completion of this certificate, the elective course required for the certificate will count retroactively towards the MA degree requirements.


Please contact the 
Director of Graduate Admissions for the Linguistics Department
 for additional information. The department is located in BU’s College of Arts & Sciences at 
621 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston MA 02215
.


Linguistics Learning Outcomes


Students who complete the Graduate Certificate in Linguistics will be able to demonstrate:




An understanding of the fundamental questions that drive modern linguistic research.


The ability to identify and describe with precision the empirical patterns found in sets of language data, and to construct well-reasoned linguistic analyses by formulating, testing, and refining hypotheses about these patterns.


Foundational knowledge in the core areas of phonetics, syntax, and semantics necessary to apply to graduate programs in linguistics and to take more advanced courses in the field.

 Historical and Comparative Linguistics


This course explores different approaches to historical linguistics, the study of language change. We will discuss various types of linguistic change (phonological, morphological, semantic, and syntactic) and the methods used to investigate these changes. Throughout the course we will address the contribution of historical linguistics to understanding prehistory. Another important topic of this course is linguistic reconstruction (reconstruction of protolanguages), its methods and goals. We also explore the social and linguistic motivations for linguistic change. Finally, we will consider language contact and borrowing and genetic/genealogical classification of languages.  [ 4 cr. ]
