According to the report, “Amidst these uncertainties, there are opportunities for insurers to thrive by embracing key actions. These include accelerating IT transformation, orchestrating the insurance ecosystem, exploring new products, addressing environmental and social considerations, and mitigating digital risks. By adopting these strategies, insurers can leverage data, enhance customer experiences, promote sustainability, and bridge the cyber insurance protection gap.”

 Project Risk and Cost Management


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: PM 100. In this course, you will be introduced to macro and micro approaches to project cost estimation.

This course presents fundamental knowledge and skills for applying business analytics to managerial decision-making in corporate environments. Topics include descriptive analytics (techniques for categorizing, characterizing, consolidating, and classifying data for conversion into useful information for the purposes of understanding and analyzing business performance), predictive analytics (techniques for detection of hidden patterns in large quantities of data to segment and group data into coherent sets in order to predict behavior and trends), prescriptive analytics (techniques for identification of best alternatives for maximizing or minimizing business objectives). Students will learn how to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable analytics-based decisions. The framework of using interlinked data inputs, analytics models, and decision-support tools will be applied within a proprietary business analytics shell and demonstrated with examples from different functional areas of the enterprise.
