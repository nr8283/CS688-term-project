The digitization of the global economy has brought all manner of increased risks—from bank fraud to vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures. Law enforcement and information security professionals alike need the expertise to prevent and prevail against all variety of online attacks—from ransomware and cybercrime, to cyberterrorism.


BU’s Metropolitan College (MET) has offered criminal justice education since 1973, and has been a leader in the cross-disciplinary field of information security since 2004. Our trailblazing graduate programs in Cybercrime Investigation & Cybersecurity are designed to help you gain the expertise it takes to make a difference in the cybersecurity field.


BU MET’s master’s degree and graduate certificate programs in information security, digital forensics, cybercrime investigation, and cybersecurity offer insight into legal practices, practical digital investigative knowledge, and policies related to cybersecurity risk assessment. Full-time faculty help students develop their command of both the computer science mechanisms of digital forensics work and evidence retrieval, and the policies and legal principles of criminal justice investigations that must be adhered to in order to make findings count.


With a legacy of grant research and training partnerships with the National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, BU MET’s cybercrime and security programs prioritize getting students real-world experience and opportunities for field training—many program alumni go on to roles in federal law enforcement. Boston University is a National Security Agency (NSA)-designated 
Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense and Research
 for its MS in Computer Information Systems concentration in Security.
