“I began my path as a graduate student at BU’s College of Communication, majoring in Media Science: Marketing Communication Research. Our program offered an opportunity to earn a data analyst certificate from the MET Computer Science Department. When I took courses like Foundations of Analytics and Data Visualization (MET CS 544) and Foundations of Machine Learning (MET CS 555), I found this area quite interesting and not as difficult as I had expected. This sparked the idea of pursuing a second master’s degree in a related area.”
