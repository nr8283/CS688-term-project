Become a Skilled Digital Crime Investigator


Available on campus, online, and in a blended format, the Graduate Certificate in Digital Forensics at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) is designed to develop proficiency in digital crime scene investigation.


The fundamental role of digital systems in business—from computers and networks to all manner of smart devices—brings serious security challenges. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), more than $10 billion in losses have been reported since 2015, much of that as a result of hackers, criminals, and other “bad actors” attacking organizations through schemes such as business email compromise (BEC), ransomware, phishing, extortion, and personal data breaches (to name just a few).


To mitigate such risks to valuable information, it is important for IT specialists to obtain a comprehensive overview of digital forensics. The specialized BU MET certificate program in Digital Forensics provides you with a comprehensive knowledge of digital crime scene investigation and introduces topics such as forensic analysis policy and procedures, forensic analysis tools, data recovery, and investigation, among others.








#10, Best Online Master's in Computer Information Technology Programs


MET’s online master’s degrees in computer information technology are ranked #10 in the nation by 
U.S. News & World Report
 for 2025.
