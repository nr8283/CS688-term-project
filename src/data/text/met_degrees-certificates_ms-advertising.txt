“I have started a new job at Salesforce, managing product marketing for digital commerce and digital experience solutions. I would not have been able to land this job without my Advertising degree from BU. I have loved my classes, professors, teammates, and projects. The material I learned has helped me interview confidently at digital software companies, where I did not have any relevant work experience.”

 Social Networks in Strategic Communication Planning


Fall  ‘25
The purpose of MET CM737, Social Networks in Strategic Communication Planning, is to help students understand the rapid evolution in marketing and communications brought on by the shift in technology that has forever changed traditional media and launched powerful new communications platforms via social media. This course will focus on communications strategy -- where it's been, where it's going with a focus on executing strategies through social media platforms that align with overall business (brand) goals and objectives. To help gain this perspective, students will learn from various experts (guests to class) and hands-on exercises designed to give all students a solid baseline for the dominant and tertiary social media platforms. I fully believe that the best way to learn and understand social media is to jump in and engage with the different platforms. This class will encourage and insist that you engage with at least two social media platforms so you can bring this first-hand knowledge to class.  [ 4 cr. ]

Summer semester enrollment is not required for international students to maintain F-1 visa status. Enrollment in summer semester coursework will expedite completion of program and reduce total program cost.


International students
 seeking an F-1 visa for on-campus study must enroll full time and demonstrate availability of funds to cover the 
Estimated Cost of Graduate Study
; those who wish to study online may enroll part-time but are not eligible for a visa. Learn more about
