International Student Professional Opportunities














Boston University and Metropolitan College provide students the services and opportunities they need to boost their knowledge of various industries and career fields, and to build their professional networks.


Among the many career-building resources we offer are:




Company information sessions and guest speakers


Professional development workshops


Access to the 
BU Center for Career Development’s
 career planning and advice, including assistance with  resumes, cover letters and the job search process


A large global network of alumni, faculty members, and students, to support ongoing career and professional development




Working in the US: Optional Practical Training


International students on F-1 visas who are interested in working in the United States are eligible to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). Eligible students who successfully complete a graduate program at MET can formally apply for this opportunity to work off campus in a field related to their area of study for 12 months after graduation. Students in certain STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields such as computer science may be eligible for an additional 17 months of OPT.


The 
Boston University International Student & Scholars Office
 can provide more information on OPT requirements, and will advise you on eligibility and the application process once you start your studies in Boston.
