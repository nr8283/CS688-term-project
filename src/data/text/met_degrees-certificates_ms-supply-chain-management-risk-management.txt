Prepare for Supply Chain Disruptions as a Risk Manager


The 
Master of Science in Supply Chain Management (MSSCM)
 concentration in Risk Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) will provide you with a solid understanding of risk-related issues in managing global supply chains, along with the skills needed to plan for and mitigate risk.


Supply chains are exposed to a plethora of risk factors from extreme weather events to political and economic uncertainties. It is no wonder that 62 percent of supply chain leaders surveyed in the 2021 Deloitte Global Resilience Report believe large-scale disruptions similar to COVID-19 are likely to occur in the future.


Deloitte’s report also highlights the need for risk managers, with only 30 percent of those surveyed saying their organizations can quickly adapt and pivot in response to disruptive events—and just 34 percent confident that they can lead their organizations through future disruptions. A 2020 supply chain survey by the Capgemini Research Institute reveals that 57 percent of organizations plan to increase investment in supply chain resilience, and 84 percent view “increasing crisis-preparedness using simulations” as a key post-pandemic priority.


The MHI Annual Industry Report for 2021 indicates that more than half of the organizations surveyed say their biggest challenge is hiring and retaining qualified workers, followed by forecasting. This presents a significant opportunity for supply chain managers who are prepared to implement solid risk-mitigation plans, establish end-to-end supply chain visibility, and offer data-driven, agile solutions.

Advance Your Career in Supply Chain Management


Offered online and on campus, BU MET’s Risk Management concentration in the Supply Chain Management master’s degree program builds an understanding of business continuity planning and crisis management, preparing you with the skills needed to identify emergent threats and develop strategic responses that adhere to proven enterprise risk management principles. Along with learning to evaluate cost and resource requirements associated with major supply chain initiatives that require careful project planning, including statistical analysis of uncertainties that create operational risks, you will be able to quantify supply chain risks in terms of their likelihood and impacts so that appropriate mitigation strategies can be implemented. You will also develop systematic process-oriented approaches to evaluate supply chain performance using statistical modeling with Six Sigma principles and techniques. Capstone projects provide an opportunity to work on real-world business problems for prominent client firms while resources such as the 
Decision Sciences Research Laboratory
 connect you to the supply chain industry through collaborative applied research.


According to the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), supply chain jobs—including high-tech roles in data analysis, cloud solutions, supply chain planning, and risk management—are projected to grow in line with the national average of 9 percent over the course of the next decade. In their 2023 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a graduate degree is $113,300. In addition, the career satisfaction is high with 96% professionals planning to stay in the field in the following five years.

 Disaster Management


Prerequisite: MET AD617 -This course takes concepts covered in MET AD617 and applies them in more detail mainly to the corporate-private sector environment. During this course, we will first review the organization and processes necessary to effectively respond to and manage incidents, including the transition from emergency response and incident management to business recovery. The course will focus on disaster recovery, an absolutely essential but sometimes overlooked component of any successful corporate recovery program. Here, the emphasis is on technology recovery. This includes reviewing the key components of the IT infrastructure; how these components are accounted for in the response and recovery processes; and some best practices in technology recovery modelling. Several emerging technologies relative to cloud computing, information security, etc., are also examined. Prereq: MET AD617  [ 4 cr. ]




MET AD 618
 Technology Risk Management


Fall  ‘25

You will review principles of technology resilience and its role within the organizational enterprise risk management structure. From there, the greater technology risk landscape is evaluated, the importance of governance and compliance are reinforced, and the infrastructure and processes necessary for organizations to effectively manage technology-related incidents are examined. The course also includes an examination of how enterprises transition from incident management to technology recovery, and how leading companies design and implement cybersecurity and privacy programs.  [ 4 cr. ]

This increasingly popular framework with which to view projects and project management is derived from current research, standards, and thought leadership from PMI and other international bodies . Students will learn how to create value in projects even in today's disruptive, turbulent environment. They will learn how to apply the conceptual framework of benefits realization management (BRM) and to use tools to manage a portfolio of programs and projects strategically with an aim of sustainable project value. Value in Agile projects will be discussed. The element of the Triple Bottom Line and a focus on sustainability is part of the subject matter. Case studies and real life experiences, illustrated with guest lectures, will be intertwined with current research in project management.  [ 4 cr. ]
