Advancing the Arts Scholarship


In keeping with its responsibility to foster greater diversity and inclusion in the arts, the Arts Administration program at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) aims to recruit a student population that is more representative of the entire US population. To further this aim, the Advancing the Arts Scholarship is available to US citizens or permanent residents who have dealt with personal challenges or other barriers to their participation in the arts and are committed to making the arts accessible to all. We welcome applications from all students, including those with demonstrated experience in or a commitment to working with Latinx, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities; those who have faced a physical or mental disability; those who attended historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU); or those who are members of a federally or state-recognized Native American tribe.


Initiated in 2021, the scholarship provides a total tuition stipend of $10,000, dispersed in the amount of $2,500 per semester while the recipient remains in good academic standing within the 
Master of Science in Arts Administration
 program. Scholarship grantees are also eligible for graduate and teaching assistantships. Applications are reviewed by a committee consisting of full-time faculty, adjunct faculty, and program alumni. Applicants wishing to be considered for the scholarship should indicate this in their personal statement and provide information on their experience and qualifications.


The scholarship is awarded annually. Students should submit a completed application no later than 
March 1
 to be considered for the award.
