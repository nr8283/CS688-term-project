Learn to Manage Program and Project Portfolios


The 
Master of Science in Project Management (MSPM)
 concentration in Program & Project Portfolio Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) provides an expanded enterprise view and focus on the collection of programs and portfolios. Learn to evaluate the critical success factors that align with strategic goals of the organization and describe best practices for managing such a portfolio. You will construct a program management plan that takes advantage of best practices for the creation and management of programs and coordination of resources, schedule, finance, and risk at the enterprise level. You will also acquire in-depth practical knowledge of enterprise tools used in organizations to plan and manage a portfolio of programs and projects, and learn how to leverage project analytics data to make well-informed decisions.


According to the Project Management Institute’s 2020 
Pulse of the Profession®
, “Organizations are undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift in which projects are no longer adjacent to operations but instead primary to how work gets done and problems get solved. In today’s C-suite—and tomorrow’s—it is the portfolio that disrupts, that innovates, that expands and thrives.” As projects continue to play a central role in how organizations conduct operations, more people will be hired to manage project portfolios. The need for employees with applicable skills will continue to grow as industries become more project-oriented—and those with the talent will find an abundance of roles in a global economy that will need 25 million new project professionals by 2030 (PMI 
2021 Talent Gap Report
).


With its detailed and tool-based examination of a project’s conception, planning, budgeting, resource allocation, and implementation, BU MET’s Project Management program is beneficial to those with a broad range of professional responsibilities—from working on complex projects for global companies to designing IT infrastructure to completing consulting contracts. The group-oriented approach we take is closely aligned with how real-world projects are successfully completed.

Advance Your Career with a Master’s in Project Management


Increasingly, all work is becoming project work. BU MET’s MS in Project Management will prepare you to manage complex projects, facilitate communication between the project team and clients, and balance competing demands among scope, time, cost, and quality—providing the tools to achieve success at the highest levels of management. Coursework covers mega-projects, agile principles, project and program governance, project planning and control, project management life cycle, methodologies of effective leadership and motivation, cost and risk management, management of project quality and procurement, and communication.


Importantly, our program recognizes that to achieve project success, leadership competencies—at the strategic level—are, increasingly, the largest single differentiator. Along with teaching the mechanics for managing a project technically, we provide you with the capability to inspire, influence, negotiate, and communicate with appropriate authority.


Supplementary lecture modules and pedagogical laboratories in the areas of project, program, and portfolio management provide an unparalleled opportunity to master the tools and techniques of project management practice. Completion of the MSPM ensures that you have the knowledge to succeed on the Project Management Professional (PMP®) and Certified Associate in Project Management Certification (CAPM™) exams offered by the Project Management Institute, as well as tests leading to a Scrum Master designation.

 Project Management


Fall  ‘25
The course explores modern project management by providing an enterprise- level, experiential view of the discipline focused on connecting projects to the organization's mission, vision, and values. The theme of the course is applying key project management tools and techniques, through case-based group work, which will help students identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real-world issues. Groups select, plan, report, and then present on their project's scope, schedule, cost, risk, quality, and communications elements using tools such as the WBS, network diagram, PERT estimate, Gantt chart (including the use of MS Project), risk register, and heat map. Students also gain familiarity with important new concepts in project management: Agile frameworks, actionable sustainability thinking, and Benefits Realization Management, all of which will be important for their success not only in other graduate courses, but as they lead projects for their organizations so as to provide lasting, triple-bottom-line value. The course is aligned with the latest PMBOK' Guide from the Project Management Institute.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Project Leadership and Emerging Communication Technologies


Fall  ‘25
This course examines the increasing importance of leadership and communications in projects. Since project outcomes and the delivery of value are accomplished through teams of people, the course aims to improve the capability of a project manager to become a project leader and to excel at motivating and inspiring their teams. Students begin by gaining a better understanding of their own social, leadership, and communications styles. Self-awareness is key to the course. We investigate motivation, conflict management, negotiation skills, and the Agile principles of stewardship and servant leadership. Grounded in the use of tools, the course will provide students with templates to enhance team collaboration and communication. The course also addresses more contemporary issues in PM, including resolving ambiguity and complexity, the use of improvised working styles, sustainable PM, and issues around power and politics within the project.  [ 4 cr. ]

 Project Risk and Cost Management


Fall  ‘25
Prerequisite: PM 100. In this course, you will be introduced to macro and micro approaches to project cost estimation. Case studies of both pre-project and in-process estimating examine some of the more common perils of human irrationality associated with project estimation to help develop more sensible, achievable project outcomes. You will learn how to manage both project cost and schedule objectives using the Earned Value and Earned Schedule Measurement Systems. You will also study risk management through an examination of both individual and overall project risk and apply your learnings using advanced risk management software in an actual case study. Project quality management, procurement/contract management, and project ethics and professional conduct will be explored using case study scenarios.  [ 4 cr. ]

You’ll also gain a deep understanding of Agile project management principles and practices in order to see them as complementary rather than competitive to traditional project management.

 Project Value Strategies


Fall  ‘25
Undergraduate Prerequisites: METAD642 - Prereq AD642 
 This course will introduce students to Project Value - - a unique perspective on classical Project Management that is focused on assuring that a project delivers value that is aligned with the mission, vision, and values of an organization. This increasingly popular framework with which to view projects and project management is derived from current research, standards, and thought leadership from PMI and other international bodies . Students will learn how to create value in projects even in today's disruptive, turbulent environment. They will learn how to apply the conceptual framework of benefits realization management (BRM) and to use tools to manage a portfolio of programs and projects strategically with an aim of sustainable project value. Value in Agile projects will be discussed. The element of the Triple Bottom Line and a focus on sustainability is part of the subject matter. Case studies and real life experiences, illustrated with guest lectures, will be intertwined with current research in project management.  [ 4 cr. ]
