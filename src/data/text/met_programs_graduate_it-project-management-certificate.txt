Learn to Manage Information Technology Projects


Available on campus, online, and in a blended format, the Graduate Certificate in IT Project Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) is particularly valuable for program managers, project managers, systems analysts, designers, programmers, product owners, specialists involved in agile software development, and others engaged in the administration of technical projects.


The shortfall of qualified individuals working in project management roles around the world is significant. As projected by the 2017 Job Growth and Talent Gap in Project Management report from the Project Management Institute, employers will need almost 90 million project managers by 2027. The talent gap, however, could result in a significant financial loss of GDP—as much as $208 billion. BU MET’s IT Project Management certificate is an opportunity to earn the skills need to fill sought-after roles. Master the latest IT project management tools and techniques and gain expertise in agile software development practices and software risk management, cost estimation, and quality management. The certificate provides you with marketable skills that encompass governance of large projects and programs for both predictive and various agile lifecycles.

 Enterprise Architecture


 Graduate Prerequisites: (METCS682) or strategic IT experience or instructor's consent - This course builds upon the strong technical foundation of our MSCIS and MSCS curricula, by providing students with the CIO-level management perspective and skills of an enterprise architect, in the context of the technologies that implement those architectures. Current technologies and processes explored in the enterprise architecture context include blockchain, microservices, multimodal/analytic databases, DevOps, SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), containers/Docker, and some leverage of AI techniques. We cover both the migration of legacy enterprise systems and de novo enterprise architecture development, vendor selection and management, cybersecurity in the enterprise, and complex system integration. Enterprise architecture decisions are presented in the context of the business goals and alignment that are critical for success, given globalization and the reality that "all companies are now technology companies." The course content is rich with case studies that illustrate practical application of enterprise architecture approaches and lessons learned. The course also includes a number of realistic enterprise architecture assignments and an incremental term project with components spanning the course, to provide students with hands on enterprise architecture experience. Students develop the understanding and skills needed to define and implement successful enterprise architectures that provide real strategic and concrete value to organizations, such as substantially reducing IT costs while improving performance, agility and alignment of information technology to business goals. On-campus classrooms follow a "flipped classroom" format, where significant class time is devoted to in-class group workshops. Prereq: MET CS 682. Or strategic IT experience. Or instructor's consent.  [ 4 cr. ]
