Prepare for Supply Chain Management Careers


Offered online and on campus, the Graduate Certificate in Supply Chain Management at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) focuses on the design, optimization, and operation of a global supply chain. By examining the essentials of lean production, global supply chain coordination, risk mitigation, strategic logistics management, and import-export operations, you will be able to analyze and improve business process flows and control streams of materials, information, and services across the supply chain of a corporation.


According to the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), supply chain jobs—including high-tech roles in data analysis, cloud solutions, supply chain planning, and risk management—are projected to grow in line with the national average of 9 percent over the course of the next decade. In their 2023 career and salary survey, the ASCM found that the annual median salary for supply chain professionals with a graduate degree is $113,300. In addition, the career satisfaction is high with 96% professionals planning to stay in the field in the following five years.


The Supply Chain Management graduate certificate prepares you for opportunities in the field through a dynamic academic curriculum that leverages the latest educational technologies, flexible delivery modes, dedicated teaching teams, and direct professional contacts with industry leaders. You will become well-versed in key operations management concepts and methods, as well as state-of-the-art tools used in the process of designing and managing global supply chains.
